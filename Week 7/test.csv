(Express photo by Gurmeet Singh) As BJP leaders in Punjab’s Bathinda, Kotkapura, Fazilka and Jalandhar watched live screening of PM Narendra Modi’s interaction with farmers Friday, the events in these districts faced protests by agitating farmers. In Bathinda, a group of farmers on Friday ransacked the venue of the event leaving at least five party workers injured, police said. However, some farmers at the venue claimed anti-social elements and not peasants were behind the incident. The event in Bathinda had to be wrapped up within 15 minutes of its start. Police had to resort to lathi-charge outside the house of senior BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia in Jalandhar during the screening programme. Nearly four farmers were injured during the police action. The Kotkapura programme ended within 30 minutes as farmers arrived raising slogans against the BJP. In Fazilka, farmers showed black flags to party leaders Surjit Kumar Jyani. BJP district president Vinod Kumar Binta said: “We had erected a tent near my office in Ram Chandra Market. We had to celebrate birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and also to listen to the PM live. We had just started the programme when farmers came inside the tent and started raising slogans against us, they threw the chairs and even damaged picture of the former PM. We had no choice but to leave the venue. In a democracy, if they have the right to protest, even we have the right to organise any programme in a peaceful manner.

The issue of player welfare has come back to the fore following a spate of injuries, which has increased calls for a return to allowing five substitutions. Clubs were allowed to make five changes when last season restarted after the coronavirus shutdown. Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are two of the bosses most opposed to only using three subs And although FIFA allowed the emergency measure to continue this season, clubs voted for the Premier League to revert to just three changes. That decision leaves the Premier League as the only major division in Europe not to extend the five substitutions rule.

Referenced Symbols The numbers: Existing-home sales fell after five straight months of increases in November, as buyers were met with a record-low number of homes for sale. Total existing-home sales dipped 2.5% from October to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. October’s sales figure had been the highest in 15 years. Compared with a year ago, home sales were up nationally nearly 26%. Economists polled by MarketWatch had projected existing-home sales to dip to a median rate of 6.64 million. What happened: The inventory of homes for sale fell nearly 10% from October to a record-low of 1.28 million units, which equates to a 2.3-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered to be indicative of a balanced market. Falling inventory has created more competition for homes, pushing prices upwards.

29,"Arts and Entertainment, Business and Finance","('-',)","As Networks Dim in Age of Streaming, Studio Exec Becomes TV’s Top Gig Michael Buckner for Variety To say that 2020 requires a certain fortitude of the spirit, an ability to roll with the punches, is perhaps an understatement. Amid the backdrop of the pandemic and the ongoing, years-long digestion of several mega-mergers, from Disney-Fox to ViacomCBS to AT&T’s WarnerMedia, pretty much every legacy entertainment house in town is in the process of maneuvering a massive ship-turning effort to better point their armadas in the direction of streaming. This digital-first weltanschauung is itself unsurprising; that writing has been on the wall for years. But it has prompted realignments that are still trickling through corporate hierarchies as we approach the new year — as evidenced by the semi-monthly assortment of restructuring and layoff announcements — and slowly spelling out what it means to be a Hollywood executive in the new era. With the Walt Disney Company’s latest reorganization of its television business under Disney TV entertainment chief Dana Walden, for instance, well-liked network boss Karey Burke is shifting gears and moving to the studio side of the business after two years at ABC Entertainment and several years overseeing original programming at youth-oriented sibling cabler Freeform. Going from head of ABC Entertainment to president of 20th Television might appear to be a lateral move, but in a land in which shows are not just shows, but precious content to be played for profit long past their scheduled weeknight time slots, overseeing production for a major chunk of the Mouse House’s prolific TV enterprise — now consolidated to two studios, not three — certainly seems like a desirable expansion of purview. And perhaps being the head of a broadcast network isn’t what it used to be, as younger viewers increasingly regard linear TV as an anachronism. When NBC Entertainment chairman Paul Telegdy departed the network under a cloud of misconduct allegations and NBCU made overtures to Netflix’s Bela Bajaria, the former head of Universal Television, to oversee NBC and its cable sister networks, sources told Variety in August that she gently declined the offer. Just a month later, she would be elevated to head of global TV for Netflix, which boasts 195.2 million paying subscribers."

But Sam Ross, who was a diesel mechanic at Norfolk Southern’s Shaffers Crossing Locomotive Shop, had a feeling those days had passed. That feeling, and a schedule that kept the 25-year-old from his young family, were on his mind one day when he drove past his alma mater, Lord Botetourt High School. There, he saw a sign out front that advertised a job opening. He applied, and in 2018 he took a job at the Botetourt County Public Schools bus garage. Within six months, Norfolk Southern announced a round of layoffs in Roanoke that Ross said would have ended his job there after only three years. “It worked out pretty good,” Ross, of Troutville, said of his decision. There was one stipulation in Botetourt for the trained mechanic: He’d have to learn to drive a school bus, too.

My advice on Kringle would be yet another no. Avoid it. As a synonym for Santa Claus it carries that same whiff of desperation for word variety as “Jolly Old Elf,” “St. Nick” and “Father Christmas.” Journalists and lyricists may deploy these from time to time to avoid repetition, but you never hear them in ordinary conversations. The conflation is due to a tradition in parts of Europe that the gift bringer at Christmas is an incarnation of the young Jesus, not the old fat guy in the sleigh. How these two generous spirits merged with the traditions associated with the fourth-century Greek St. Nicholas of Myra (say the words “Saint Nicholas” and “Santa Claus” really fast a few times and they’ll merge in your mind) has been the subject of considerable scholarship. And adding to the potential confusion is that Kriss Kringle is how some people refer to the gift-giving practice we refer to as Secret Santa. The extra “s” on Kriss is likely to look like a typo to some readers. A Google search for “Kris Kringle” returns 1.5 million hits, whereas a search for “Kriss Kringle” gets only about 95,000. A Nexis search of the major U.S. newspapers database over the last five years has Kris in 589 stories and Kriss in just 53. The AP’s vice president for standards, John Daniszewski, emailed me that the wire service relied on the Kringle preferences of Webster’s New World College Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, the American Heritage Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary. “All four use Kriss Kringle,” he said."

At the time, 98 per cent of all hybrid cars on sale didn't meet that criteria. It remains unclear if the sale 50-mile rule will be used for the accelerated ban starting in nine years' time. The vagueness of the Prime Minister's latest announcement surrounding hybrids had led many to assume that only new plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) would be sold until 2035. By the end of October, just 50,00 new PHEVs have been registered in the UK so far in 2020 - just 3.6 per cent of all new cars bought. That compares to 790,000 petrol cars and 230,000 diesels."

68,"Sports, U.S.","('-',)","Bill Belichick Explains His Starting QB Decision The New England Patriots‘ head coach, Bill Belichick has made his decision at starting quarterback, and while he didn’t sound definitive at first, he gave a more concrete answer to the question on Monday. Some are Calling For Newton to Be Benched The Boston Sports Journal’s Greg Bedard was merciless in his critique of Newton’s play on Sunday. The veteran sportswriter called for Belichick to go to Jarrett Stidham as his starting quarterback, despite the fact that the Patriots came away victorious, and have won three of their last four games. Bedard wrote: That was unacceptable. Or, at least it should be if Bill Belichick truly believes what he preaches to his players about every decision he makes: Belichick does what’s in the best interest of the team. If that’s the case, then he needs to have a serious discussion with Josh McDaniels and Jedd Fisch about possibly benching Newton for Jarrett Stidham. Newton was terrible on Sunday in the Patriots’ eventual 20-17 victory over the Cardinals that was basically done without any of Newton’s help — unless you want to count the gift personal foul penalty he drew to set up the game-winning field goal. What you saw on Sunday was a Patriots team trying to win despite having — insert god-awful NFL quarterback’s name here (Tim Tebow, Trevor Siemian, Ryan Finley, David Blough, Jeff Driskel, etc) — as their quarterback. Yes, it was that bad. Bedard isn’t overstating Newton’s struggles on Sunday, but he is overreacting with his insistence for the Patriots to make a change at quarterback. Changing the starter in the midst of a 3-1 stretch simply makes no sense unless there is an injury."

Officials under President Donald Trump unveiled the new civics test on Friday that replaces a President George W. Bush-era test that’s been used for the last 12 years. It’s the final hurdle to naturalization before America’s immigrants receive their decision from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and take the Oath of Allegiance in a naturalization ceremony. The USCIS began revising the test in 2019 in an effort to refresh it every 10 years. The last time it was updated was in 2008 during Bush’s presidency, leaving the Obama administration with no pressing need to touch the test during its tenure. With the 10-year mark coming in 2018, it fell squarely in the Trump administration’s purview. Basic civics questions remain the same including “how many U.S. senators are there?” and “how many amendments does the U.S. Constitution have?” but the wording for some is more complex. Applicants are asked to “name two important ideas from the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution” instead of “what are two rights in the Declaration of Independence?” In the former test, the applicant need only say a combination of terms in the famous phrase: “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Correct answers to the new test, however, include more specifics terms such as “equality,” “social contract,” “natural rights,” “limited government,” and “self-government.” The term “citizen” also replaces “people” when it comes to representation in some questions, as the Washington Post noted. When asked, “who does a member of the House of Representatives represent?” or “who does a U.S. senator represent?” the correct answer must include citizens and not people. For US representatives, the right answers would be “citizens in their (congressional) district” and “citizens in their district,” while for senators, the right answer would be “citizens of their state.”"

Navalny carried out his sting operation after a joint investigation by CNN and Bellingcat, an Internet investigative journalism operation, identified several members of an FSB unit that was detailed to follow Navalny during his trip to Siberia in August. Some of the agents were said to be experts in using toxins and nerve agents. As CNN told the tale Monday, while its reporters were busy badgering members of the FSB team for interviews and getting doors slammed in their faces, Navalny decided to start calling them on the phone from his secret convalescent facility in Germany. He did not get far by telling the state security operatives he was Alexei Navalny and he wanted to ask a few questions about why they poisoned him. CNN’s partners at Bellingcat said that is literally how Navalny began the conversation with the first few FSB team members and associated chemical weapons specialists he called. All of them immediately hung up on Navalny except for scientist Oleg Demidov, who said he could not talk because he had contracted the Chinese coronavirus. When Navalny got around to calling agent Konstantin Kudryavtsev, he took a different approach.

He took the extra precaution of spoofing his phone numbers so Kudryavtsev would think he was phoning from FSB headquarters in Moscow instead of Germany. Navalny’s gambit allegedly paid off, because he presented CNN and Bellingcat with a 45-minute recording of Kudryavtsev discussing the Tomsk operation in detail, with only occasional flashes of apprehension about discussing state-sanctioned political murder over an open phone line. Among other details, Kudryavtsev allegedly said the Novichok was administered to Navalny by lacing “the insides, the crotch” of his underwear with grains of the nerve toxin in solid form. He said major care was taken to ensure there would be no traces of the poison would be left behind, although CNN noted that Russian officials have repeatedly and inexplicably refused to return Navalny’s clothing to him from Siberia, thwarting forensic investigation."

The anniversary arrives after President Donald Trump’s historic Abraham Accords brought real and positive change to the Middle East, but next year is poised to bring back the kind of foreign policy thinking that led to the cascade failure of corrupt governments and the rise of Islamism a decade ago. The inciting event of the Arab Spring was the death of Bouazizi, an impoverished 27-year-old street vendor frequently harassed by government officials despite the minuscule size of his enterprise. On that fateful December 17, inspectors confiscated his merchandise after accusing him of doing business without the necessary permits. Bouazizi marched to the governor’s office to plead his case and, when the governor refused to speak with him, he set himself on fire. It took Bouazizi about two weeks to die from his self-inflicted injuries. During that time, protests against government corruption and economic despair in Tunisia grew into a movement powerful enough to topple President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from the office he held for 23 years. Inspired and emboldened by the ouster of Ben Ali, activists in other countries launched similar protests, with the largest and most successful occurring against longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who resigned in February 2011. The movement – dubbed the “Arab Spring” because it supposedly marked the flourishing of democracy after decades of authoritarian dictatorship, even though it mostly occurred during the winter of 2010-2011 – also sparked or exacerbated some brutal civil wars, including the bloody chaos in Libya, the brutal revolt against Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and the ongoing Iran-backed insurgency in Yemen."

Schiff insisted in March 2017 that there was “more than circumstantial” evidence of collusion. Ultimately, however, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation found that there was, in fact, no evidence that any American colluded with Russia. Schiff also defended the FBI, claiming it had done nothing wrong in seeking secret FISA warrants against Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

Judge David R. Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of Texas is weighing a proposed order to sell the 75-year-old monthly magazine to Junior Bridgeman's Bridgeman Sports and Media LLC, according to court records. Bridgeman Sports and Media placed the high bid of $14 million in a bankruptcy court-supervised auction, but creditors have objected to the proposed sale that would be free of all liens, claims and encumbrances. Ebony, a magazine covering African-American culture that was long based in Chicago, was forced into bankruptcy in July by creditors it owed more than $11.8 million. But the case was later turned into a chapter 11 bankruptcy meant to reorganize the company and shed its debts so it could remain a going concern, according U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of Texas filings. The iconic magazine, which once had a print circulation of 1.7 million and reached an estimated 40% of African-American homes, had defaulted on its loans, according to court records. It was started by Johnson Publishing in downtown Chicago, which also published Jet magazine before liquidating last year. Ebony was most recently based in Los Angeles. Bridgeman, who sought to buy Sports Illustrated two years ago before it was ultimately acquired by Authentic Brands Group, starred on the legendary 1971 state champion East Chicago Washington High School basketball team. He went on to play for the University of Louisville and in the NBA. He played 12 years for the Milwaukee Bucks, where he averaged double-digit points as a sixth man and got his No. 2 jersey retired by the team. After retiring, Bridgeman — whose name is Ulysses Bridgeman — built a fast food empire that included more than 450 Wendy's, Chili's, Fazoli's, Perkin's, Golden Corral and Blaze Pizza restaurants. He now runs Heartland Coca-Cola, an independent Coca-Cola bottler with 18 regional distribution centers across the Midwest. The Richest website estimates Bridgeman's net worth is at least $600 million, and Forbes magazine has identified him as one of the highest-paid retired athletes in the nation."

Quarterback Michael Pratt proceeded to throw an interception before getting sacked four times in the span of five plays over two critical possessions in the fourth. Nevada, which was averaging 1.6 sacks, registered a season-high eight against Pratt, with six of them coming after Claybrook exited in favor of graduate transfer Jaylen Miller. “We needed to step up and really put pressure on the quarterback,” Nevada coach Jay Norvell said. “We did that and that was huge in the game. You know the one series, I think we had three sacks in a row, and back them up when they had really good field position and that was huge.” When Claybrook went out with an injury in the first half against Houston in Pratt’s first start, Tulane failed to rush for 100 yards for what still is the only time in coach Willie Fritz’s five-year tenure. Then-offensive coordinator Will Hall later termed that performance a debacle. This one was even rougher. Tulane produced minus-6 yards of offense in the fourth quarter until running back Cameron Carroll scored on a 65-yard jaunt with seven seconds left. Tulane already was playing without its starters on the right side of its offensive line.

He would be the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson (2006-2007) to lead the league in consecutive seasons. GREEN BAY — Matt LaFleur knows better than anyone what the Green Bay Packers defense will be up against Sunday night when the Tennessee Titans and 247-pound freight train/running back Derrick Henry come to Lambeau Field. As the Titans’ offensive coordinator in 2018, the Packers coach saw Henry up close during his breakout season that year, when Henry ran for 1,059 yards and 12 touchdowns — including a 99-yarder — in the first of his three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. Now, Henry enters Sunday night only 321 yards away from becoming the eighth back in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. In addition to his 1,679 yards, he’s also scored 15 touchdowns, is averaging a career-best 5.2 yards per carry and 119.9 yards per game, and has picked up 81 first downs on the ground. “He is a beast. And you can see it,” LaFleur said earlier this week. “He’s playing with a lot of confidence. You can see all 11 guys, they’re very efficient on offense, both in the run game and the pass game. Obviously, when you have a guy of the caliber of Derrick Henry, who’s a big man that is very, very fast, it sets everything up for you. They know each and every week everybody’s going to come to try to stop the run and nobody can do it.” Actually, a few teams have managed to slow Henry down this season — just not many lately. Although he’s cracked the 100-yard barrier in five of the Titans’ past six games, a few defenses have managed to mitigate his impact this year: the Cleveland Browns (15 carries, 60 yards, no touchdowns) on Dec. 6; the Chicago Bears (21 carries, 68 yards, no TDs on Nov. 8); the Pittsburgh Steelers (20 carries, 75 yards, one TD on Oct. 25); and the Jacksonville Jaguars (25 carries, 84 yards, no TDs on Sept. 20)."

Instead, it’s a matchup between two teams trying to hold things together amid a bevy of injuries, COVID-19 outbreaks and shortcomings that might leave both of them well short of a Super Bowl berth come February. With virtually every one of their stars on injured reserve, the 49ers (4-4) are a shell of the team that beat the Packers soundly on Jan. 19 — by a 37-20 score that wasn’t that close — and may not even make the playoffs in an ultra-competitive NFC West. In fact, only three of the 49ers’ offensive starters from that NFC title game — fullback Kyle Juszczyk, left guard Laken Tomlinson and right tackle Mike McGlinchey — are set to start. And in the wake of wide receiver Kendrick Bourne’s reported positive COVID-19 test on Wednesday morning that closed the team’s practice facility, every player who touched the ball for the 49ers in the NFC title game is injured, on the COVID-19 list or playing elsewhere. And the Packers (5-2), despite holding the NFC North lead, have now added infection to injury, with rookie No. 3 running back AJ Dillon having tested positive for the novel coronavirus and No. 2 running back Jamaal Williams, who’d held down the backfield fort the past two weeks with starter Aaron Jones sidelined with a calf injury, also out for this game because he was deemed a high-risk close contact of Dillon’s. Add in the truncated week, with the 49ers coming off a road loss at Seattle and the Packers having been run over by the Minnesota Vikings at Lambeau Field, and these are hardly the ideal circumstances for a rematch — assuming the game remains on, which as of Wednesday evening the NFL said was still the case. And yet, both 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan and Packers coach Matt LaFleur — longtime friends who spent much of their careers together working their way up the NFL ranks and whose offensive schemes bear striking resemblances — insist they spent the short week embracing the challenges facing their teams."

It’s a mixture of mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and grated Parmesan cheese. Not only does this spread add big flavor to the bread before the melting cheese is even involved, but it also keeps the sandwiches from tasting dry. The tanginess of the mustard also helps cut through the richness of the cheese, for a more balanced bite. Next, Garten makes these sandwiches truly worthy of dinner time by adding diced cooked bacon to each one – just a few small pieces on each sandwich. After all, “It’s a cheese sandwich, not a bacon sandwich!” as she says in the video. The bacon adds a smoky, savory flavor to each sandwich that plays well with the cheese, and that smokiness is extra delicious when paired with a bowl of Garten’s signature tomato soup."

In each case, the IDs that you sign in with can also be used to manage the IDs of younger family members, limiting their screen time inside apps and protecting them against unsuitable content. Here's how to get everything set up. Apple Family Sharing works across Apple devices and Apple services.Screenshot: David Nield via Apple Apple's single stop for family account management is Family Sharing—besides yourself, you can add up to five other people, kids or otherwise, and then share everything from Apple Music to purchased apps to iCloud storage. Children age 13 and over can have their own Apple ID. For younger children, you can create and manage an Apple ID for them. To get started with Family Sharing, open Settings on an iPhone or iPad, tap your Apple ID name, then choose Family Sharing and Set Up Your Family. If you're on a Mac, open up System Preferences, then choose Family Sharing. Follow the instructions to invite people to your family or set up the necessary Apple IDs for your youngsters. With your family created, services such as Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple News Plus, and Apple Arcade are shared automatically if you've subscribed to them. Any iCloud storage you've purchased is pooled between family members, and Photos automatically creates a shared album for everyone to use. Most of this happens without any effort on your part—when people in your family sign into their Apple account, they'll see the same apps and services available as you do. In terms of looking after your children, there are a few key tools bundled with Family Sharing. You can look up their locations on a map at any time—to do this, open up the Find My app on iOS or macOS and select the people you want to share your location with. You can also make sure that app, movie, music, and other purchases your kids try to make go through you first: After tapping your Apple ID in Settings on iOS or opening System Preferences on macOS, choose Family Sharing then Ask to Buy to set this up."

COVID-19 vaccine administration to healthy Americans may begin as soon as late-March or early April, in a best-case scenario. A majority of Americans will need to take the vaccine to conquer the coronavirus pandemic. During a TV interview this weekend, Brett P. Giroir, the current Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said that every American will have access to a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of June. The news is encouraging, especially amid early concerns regarding the ability of companies like Pfizer and Moderna to manufacture enough doses to vaccinate a sufficient amount of people. Recall that the coronavirus vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart, which is to say that 20 million doses, for example, is only enough to vaccinate 10 million people. An estimated 75-85% of Americans will have to take a coronavirus vaccine to establish herd immunity, according to Dr. Fauci.

For some, the chance to purge unwanted items can be genuinely spiritually healing, but I tend to feel nothing but misery when I’m forced to part with anything of any degree of significance (including old CVS receipts, depending on what I bought and whom I was with). “I am holding on,” Satenstein wrote of her perennially messy desk last year, back when we still commuted to the Vogue offices, and I can relate; even with unlimited time at home, I’ve found it difficult to get rid of even the most outdated and useless of physical possessions. Luckily, the one place where I am a minimalist is on social media; ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in March, I’ve discovered the ineffable joy of paring my Twitter and Instagram down to the point where I’m only following accounts I genuinely enjoy. But how do you do that? After all, isn’t hate-following that girl from your old job who once ate your yogurt at least half of the point of social media? And how do you opt out of the updates of college acquaintances you don’t particularly care about, without going so far as to formally unfollow and make the next reunion super awkward? The answer, my friends, is muting, and let me say it once for posterity: Muting is good. Muting is free, easy, hurts nobody, and—if you do it right—can genuinely protect your mental health. Until this year, I’d saved muting only for exes I was still on “good terms” with, yet still felt heartbroken enough about to spontaneously dissolve into tears every time I saw one of their tweets. As I made my way through this spring alone, though, I began to realize that actually, I could mute anyone, anytime I wanted. At first, I mainly reserved my muting for friends of friends who persisted in flouting social-distancing guidelines on Instagram, crowding 10 unmasked people into a room above the caption “socially distanced!” or traveling constantly between states with seemingly no concern for the potential COVID exposure they represented. I didn’t want to turn into an insufferable Instagram scold (with people I barely knew, no less), but I also…didn’t want to see that content. So I muted, and suddenly, my feed looked more like the quiet life I was experiencing. It was markedly easier to spend almost all my time at home when I wasn’t being taunted by the constant reminder that other people weren’t. Advertisement"

Now it's built into various TVs and sold in sticks and cubes. But one constant has remained: a bloated, ad-filled user interface that lags behind the competition. Not anymore, though. The rollout for what the company is calling the ""new Fire TV Experience"" has begun, with support coming to nearly all Fire TV products by early 2021 — with the exception of first-generation Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices. Amazon's stated goal is to make it faster and easier to find what you want to watch with a number of quality-of-life upgrades.

There are just three weeks to go until Black Friday 2020 arrives, and it might be one of the only normal things to look forward to this holiday season. The election has been anything but normal, and families will be avoiding big gatherings due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The weeks ahead of Black Friday 2020 are also quite different than what we’ve seen in the past. For one thing, so many Black Friday deals are already available now since people are trying to take care of holiday shopping early to avoid shipping bottlenecks. For another, the hottest deals among our readers right now aren’t on any gadgets or gizmos — instead, they’re deals on coronavirus pandemic essentials. FDA-authorized Powecom KN95 masks (on sale right now at the lowest price ever!) and Nan Qi Xing KN95 masks are by far the hottest items because they’re the only KN95 masks on Amazon that have been tested by NIOSH. They’re also deeply discounted right now and so is Purell hand sanitizer, which is pretty shocking. Sleek black KN95 face masks are big-sellers as well right now at just $1.40 each, and tons of people are stocking up on Clorox wipes, even at inflated prices. With COVID-19 case numbers continuing to climb, prices will unfortunately continue to increase in the coming weeks. The good news for holiday shoppers is that there are plenty of deals on nonessentials, too. As we mentioned, Amazon’s Holiday Dash deals hub is packed full of deep discounts ahead of this year’s Black Friday shopping blitz. Definitely dig around through there to see all of today’s top deals, but there are five in particular that we wanted to bring to your attention. First and foremost, Apple’s AirPods 2 just dropped to $99 at Amazon. That’s no typo… they’re under $100 for the first time ever! That’s a $60 discount and it’s completely unprecedented. AirPods Pro and AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case are discounted as well, and you can check out both of those deals right here. Mpow 059 Wireless Headphones – $22.49 (reg. $40) IMPRESSIVE SOUND QUALITY IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL: The High-fidelity stereo sound benefits from the 40mm neodymium driver, CSR chip, and the around-ear cushion design which provide a well-closed and immersed environment for your ears, Just lose yourself in the music! NOTE: Mpow 059 headphones are passive noise isolating, NOT active noise cancellation(ANC), it can’t cancel the noise completely but it won’t drain the battery and damage the sound. 2.

In fact, you can head over to Amazon right now and you’ll find several sales that are just as good as those deals. But what many people don’t realize is that Amazon’s holiday deals hub has some bargains right now that are even better than what we saw on Black Friday this year. It makes sense, of course, since there are plenty of companies out there with unsold inventory after overstocking for Black Friday and Cyber Week. Anyone in search of a small to medium-sized TV will be delighted by the kind of value you can get right now. Examples include the best-selling TCL 40S325 40-Inch Roku TV with more than 21,000 5-star reviews for just $199.99 and a larger TCL 50-inch 4K Smart LED Roku TV is $279.99. Those are both killer values and there’s plenty more where that came from, but there’s one deal in particular that you need to check if you’re on the prowl for a giant flat-screen TV. BGR’s Top Deal of the Day If you’re looking for a nice big TV, a 65-inch TV simply isn’t huge enough for many people these days. That’s fine though, since prices have come down to the point where getting a decent 70-inch TV costs about as much as a decent 65-inch TV would’ve cost a couple of years ago. If you have the space for it — heck, even if you don’t have the space for it — 70+ inches is definitely the way to go instead of a 65-inch model. That’s especially true if you’re shopping for a new TV right now ahead of Christmas because there are three terrific models from top brands on sale at great prices. Our favorite deal by far is the LG 70UN7370PUC 70-inch 4K Smart UHD HDR Smart TV that retails for $1,000, which is already a pretty incredible value. It was on sale for around $800 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and it flew off the shelves at that price. Now, a $373 discount slashes the price to just $626.99. That’s insane!

Tagovailoa was the No. 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft after an outstanding career at Alabama, where he totaled 76 passing touchdowns and just nine interceptions over his final two seasons. The rookie has also reportedly impressed in practices, causing the coaching staff to make the switch over the Week 7 bye despite a 3-3 record under Fitzpatrick.

The most notable inclusion is revenue sharing, which would give athletes in football (both FBS and FCS levels), men's and women's basketball and baseball the right to 50 percent of money remaining after scholarships are paid. One issue would be the fact that athletic departments often use profits from these teams to help fund other sports at the schools.

The Saratoga County Board of Supervisors passed legislation that cuts sewer bills for any restaurants that pay their own sewer bills. The measure is meant to help during the pandemic. BALLSTON SPA – A break on county sewer bills for 78 Saratoga County restaurants - including a local strip club and many chain establishments like McDonald’s and Chili’s - is upsetting some elected officials who say that all restaurants should be getting aid during the pandemic. The Saratoga County Board of Supervisors approved taking 50 percent off restaurant sewer bills - which can not be applied to restaurants that don't pay their own sewer bills, like in a plaza. The break also does not apply to any Saratoga Springs restaurants because they do not use county sewer. Mechanicville Supervisor Tom Richardson, who came up with the plan, says it’s only logical. The county, he said, can’t give a discount on sewer charges if the restaurant doesn’t get a sewer bill. “It’s that simple,” Richardson said of the plan that was approved last month by the Board of Supervisors. “Restaurants are the hardest hit by the pandemic. My first thought is to help them and then delve deeper into this to take a look at what other businesses we can help.” However, Clifton Park Supervisor Phil Barrett says the idea of helping only restaurants that are hooked into county sewer and not offering relief to restaurants elsewhere or those attached to a plaza is unfair. “A broader program would be much more effective and fair,” Barrett said. “It’s giving an unfair competitive advantage to restaurants that are in close proximity to each other. The county is using entirely questionable criteria, leaving a large number of restaurants out of the program.”"

Cortney grabbed this yesterday morning, but you’re starting to see that even the most anti-Trump networks out there are starting to ask why Nancy Pelosi held up COVID relief for months. We have a $900 billion spending bill. It has COVID relief. And it was done just before the government ran out of money. It was a must-pass bill. So, of course, every piece of pork is in this 5,000+-page monstrosity. Most of the hold ups were over mere rounding errors in federal budgeting. It’s a near-one trillion-dollar bill and folks were holding up the works to fight over a few billion dollars. Meanwhile, millions of Americans had expected this relief months ago. So, given the relative ease of this bill, some in the media are actually asking questions that Pelosi probably hates, like why did you inflict untold economic misery on Americans for this long a period of time when it looks like a couple of relief packages could have been hashed out before Election Day. I think you all know the answer. It’s because Pelosi wasn’t going to help Trump win a second term. New COVID relief would have helped Trump, especially when the latest push for a relief package was being debated on the Hill. It was too close to Election Day. In the Senate, I’m sure Chuck Schumer knew it would help the GOP keep the Senate. Now, there are $600 checks to help families pay months of bills that have stacked up. Pelosi and her crew decided to torture Americans to better the chances for Biden. This is why those who say ‘country over party’ need to be beaten mercilessly. That’s not really a thing with these people. I admit that I’d vote for ANY Republican over a Democrat no matter what. I’m a base voter all the way. But Trump wanted a deal. Trump offered Pelosi many opportunities to strike a deal. We were flexible on a host of things regarding the price tag. And there was leftover money from past packages regarding school funding and food programs. In August, this point was made by PBS’ Judy Woodruff, which caused Madam Speaker to have a meltdown; all her entire talking points got wrecked. To avoid another incident like this, Pelosi merely just ignored CNN’s Manu Raju. Why? Is it because Pelosi is a sadist? I don’t know. All we know is that it’s pretty hard to see how a deal was out of reach in months past but is possible now without seeing the explicit political nonsense here. ‘Biden won, so there can be COVID relief’ is what they’re shoving in our faces. Also, these clowns who held up the show on this are now getting COVID vaccinations. This is why Trump won in 2016. It’s only fueling and entrenching the populist sentiments on both sides. Pelosi will be annoyed by liberal journalists, but she won’t be held accountable for causing immeasurable pain and suffering to American families who need it most right now. COVID has torched the livelihoods of millions. Congress did nothing because Democrats chose to do so. And now, they think all is forgiven or worse—all is resolved with a $600 payment. You might as well have told us to go screw off and die. There are a lot of bad eggs on the Hill, but Nancy Pelosi might be the most rotten of them all."

Betts scored his first collegiate touchdown on a 45-yard fly sweep that he took moving to the offense’s right, found a big seam, turned up the field and turned on the jets, running away easily from Penn State’s defense in the second quarter to give the Huskers a 17-6 lead. “We put that in early this week and I was like, ‘Wait a minute, we ran this play in high school. I’m going to love this play,’” he said. “When I got that call in the game, I was just excited. There was no nerves in me. I was ready to go. I wanted that play so bad.” Indeed, Betts made a lot of hay with the play in Michael Huffman’s offense at Bellevue West. Among the highlights: An 86-yard touchdown his senior season in the playoffs off of the same action. “What I originally saw was Marvin (Scott) kicked out I think it was the outside linebacker, the tight end kicked out the safety and Marcus (Fleming) was taking out the corner, and they really just created a huge hold that I was able to just power through and I just took off,” Betts said."

That’s not because I doubted the show but because I try to manage my expectations,” mused Julia Stiles, the show’s lead actress, and executive producer. “Whenever you’re making something, you hope that it finds an audience. I’ve been acting long enough that I’ve seen movies and TV shows have success and also, you know, disappear into oblivion. I usually don’t try to predict what the reception is going to be.” Audiences got on board in a big way with the original series’ first episode drawing 1.2 million people on Sky Atlantic. The drama, set in the dark underbelly of the world of the wealthy in the French region, reportedly drew an audience of 2.3 million per episode after that. The third season of Riviera premieres on Sundance Now on Thursday, November 5, 2020. “I think that she’s the window into that world; that’s why people relate to my character, Georgina, and got into the show in the first place,” Stiles enthused. “Because she doesn’t come from wealth or a particularly upper-class family, quite the opposite. I think she allows people to see the glamour, the trappings of wealth, and that lifestyle through her perspective.” “I think that’s what appealed to me about the show when I first signed on to it was the famous quote about the French Riviera being a sunny place for shady people. So this contrast between the luxury and what is underneath it, seeing how wealth doesn’t necessarily buy happiness, that it can create quite a lot of destruction.” As the third season drops in the US, what lies ahead for Riviera? More seasons or perhaps a feature-length film finale? “A movie? I’ve never thought of that, but who knows? We are talking about season four, but there’s nothing official yet,” Stiles explained.” Without giving too much away, the ending of season three leaves a lot open for what we could do. The biggest question is, how would you film a series like this, that’s so international, in the world we live in now. How would you film it given all the travel and border restrictions?” “I also think the line between film and television is almost non-existent now because everybody watches, mostly from home these days. Many things you would only previously find in feature films, you can now find on the small screen. Also, the quality of television is so much better than when I first started acting. What is excellent is how we binge-watch, and shows have become a lot less episodic in an isolated way; they have to be composed as an arc, from start to finish, and there is more room to explore things. “"

224,"Sports, U.S. Regional","('-', 'Sports')","Former NFL Executive: Lions Must Target Big Name College Coach The Detroit Lions have plenty of avenues to take when they target new leadership for the future, but quite possibly one of the most important things they should look to do is establish a new culture. Former NFL executive Michael Lombardi was recently asked about what went wrong for Matt Patricia and Bob Quinn on VSIN, and as he said, he believed the duo’s inability to establish a positive culture had everything to do with their demise. As a result, Lombardi thinks Detroit should eventually be targeting names like Matt Campbell from Iowa State and Dabo Swinney from Clemson given what they’ve done to build programs. “I think the number one thing I’d do in Detroit, they’ve never had a real organization. This is a team that’s in constant search of a coach and constant search of a GM and never in search of a culture. They don’t know they don’t know. They really don’t. They think it’s all about hiring one magical person. And yet it’s about building a culture. If I was the president of the Lions, I would hire a general manager and a coach to simultaneously build the culture. I would look to a college coach, whether it be Matt Campbell, whether it be Dabo Swinney. I would look to a college coach to come in and build the culture around something that was positive. Because look, following Matt Patricia isn’t going to be a hard thing to do. Matt Patricia took over a team that was 36-30 under Jim Caldwell and he ruined it to a 13-29 team because he said there were no players there and Bob Quinn the general manager allowed him to do it. If I took over that team, it would be all about culture.” As Lombardi also said, the reason he’d target a college coach is a team like the Lions needs someone to treat the team like a program and bring that mentality into focus. Considering all that’s gone wrong in Detroit, it’s tough to disagree with that assessment at all. The Lions have not hired a college coach since Darryl Rogers left Arizona State to join the team in 1985, and that experiment backfired in a big way when Rogers went 18-40 in his career, a mark not that unlike Matt Patricia’s with the Lions. Perhaps over 30 years later, it’s time to try again, however. Lombardi clearly thinks that’s the case. Dabo Swinney Career Profile"

230,"Media, Metro New York, Politics, Technology, U.S.","('-', 'Content Source Geo', 'Country')","COVID is Still Raging Across the Country—And Inside the White House Mark Meadows is reportedly one of at least five Trump aides with active COVID infections—a diagnosis the chief of staff and White House tried to keep a secret until it was disclosed by the media late Friday. In the midst of Donald Trump’s post-election litigation blitz, another outbreak of the coronavirus is reportedly spreading in the White House. According to Bloomberg, the president’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is one of at least five White House officials who has tested positive for COVID-19, a diagnosis Meadows received on Wednesday after spending election night in the White House Residence with all of the family principles as well as in the East Room for Trump’s 2:30 a.m. address. The chief of staff was reportedly not wearing a mask on Tuesday and was again without a face covering when he returned to campaign headquarters on Wednesday. Not only did Meadows decide against issuing a statement after testing positive for the coronavirus—he instead told a small circle of advisers after Election Day, who were instructed to keep quiet—but apparently took pains to conceal his active infection from other administration staffers. New York’s Olivia Nuzzireported that “Meadows and the White House went to great lengths to keep his diagnosis a secret. This is despite alleged contact tracing efforts.” Jennifer Jacobs, part of the Bloomberg team that broke the story, notes that putting out a statement immediately following his diagnosis would have allowed the many aides excluded from the White House Medical Unit’s guidance for contact tracing but who had been in direct contact with Meadows to take precautions. White House and campaign staffers, already dealing with a political crisis as their boss attempts to challenge ballot counts in several battleground states, instead learned of the latest outbreak when it was reported by the media. This is not the first time that West Wing aides have found out about a positive diagnosis in their midst from Jacobs, Nuzzi pointed out, nor is it the administration’s first attempt to “keep a coronavirus outbreak a secret from people who work in the White House and might have contracted the virus from the official who tested positive.” The latest White House outbreak is a pointed reminder that the pandemic is still raging, drowned out by election coverage this week but quietly surging across much of the country, which on Friday reported more than 100,000 new infections for the third straight day and more than 1,000 deaths for the fourth straight day. At least 24 states recorded more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch since the start of the pandemic, per the New York Times. “I feel like this is the background and we’re all focused on those results and the pandemic, the virus doesn’t care what we’re doing,"" said MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, who broke from election coverage on Friday to highlight a grim increase in hospitalizations. The virus, Hayes remarked, ""doesn’t care about our elections, it doesn’t care about what party people vote for,” a reality evidenced by Rachel Maddow’s disappearance from the network later that night due to potential virus exposure. MSNBC’s biggest star said in a statement on Friday evening that she was placing herself under quarantine after someone close to her tested positive for COVID-19, noting she had “tested negative thus far” but would be at home until “it’s safe for me to be back at work without putting anyone at risk.”"

But a particularly nasty iPhone exploit (via Ars Technica) allowed for an attacker to instantly take over someone's iPhone from a distance, without the need for any user interaction. It's really as scary as it sounds: Just look at the video of it in action, below. The exploit was found by security researcher Ian Beer, who works at Google's Project Zero team. It involves a vulnerability in AWDL, Apple's protocol that allows iPhones, Macs, and other devices to create peer-to-peer mesh networks, which enable features such as AirDrop and AirPlay. Finding the exploit was not easy — Beer has a lengthy technical explanation of how he did it, if you're up for it — but the bottom line was that it allows an attacker to remotely reboot iPhones, and completely take them over after they've been rebooted, with access to photos, messages, and other user data. Check out a demonstration of an attack that uses this exploit in action in the video, below. Now, the good news: Apple has already patched the exploit in May 2020, meaning that iPhones with the latest security updates are all secure. Also, Beer himself notes he has no evidence that the bug was exploited in the wild."

The Chancellor's comments as he unveiled his spending review had echoes of a wider Thatcherite vision of the nation, as espoused by the former prime minister in her famous 1987 interview where she said 'there's no such thing as society'. Mr Sunak addressed the Commons this afternoon as he set out how he intends to limit the economic shock of coronavirus - using distinctly un-Thatcher-like levels of public spending and national debt. Unveiling his crucial Spending Review, the Chancellor declared that billions of pounds will be pumped into getting the unemployed back to work, as well as boosting infrastructure, the NHS and defence, in a bid to create a platform for recovery. The backdrop to the latest intervention was incredibly grim forecasts from the government's fiscal watchdog, with Mr Sunak admitting borrowing is expected to hit £394billion this year as the economy shrinks by 11.3 per cent - the worst recession in more than 300 years. As he closed his statement to Parliament, Mr Sunak said: 'We in Government can set the direction – better schools, more homes, stronger defence, safer streets, green energy, technological development, improved rail, enhanced roads, all investments that will create jobs and give every person in this country the chance to meet their potential."

Cavani, 33, has missed the last three matches due to a groin injury but is in line for his first appearance since he was forced off in the win at West Ham two weeks ago. Eric Bailly has recovered from a minor injury to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's matchday squad, which will feature 20 players, rather than the usual 18, on Sunday. Leeds travel to Old Trafford in the league for the first time since February 2004 on Sunday after a 16-year absence from the top-flight and could go to within three points of United with a win. Solskjaer first played at Elland Road in 1996 and scored four times against Leeds, including two in a thrilling 4-3 victory in 2002, and was also on the pitch for compatriot Alf-Inge Haaland's infamous reaction to Roy Keane after he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in 1997."

Gillespie/Capital Gazette) The big white tent outside Boatyard Bar and Grill has been there for months during the coronavirus pandemic, a necessary addition to the Eastport restaurant’s facade, making up for lost capacity inside. Recently, owner Dick Franyo has added two heaters to the tent, with two more on the way, as winter approaches and temperatures dip. This is the next phase in Annapolis restaurants' ongoing struggle to stay open and operating during the pandemic — renting expensive tents and heaters to avoid losing the outdoor capacity that has helped some businesses survive the last eight months. Yet, some have already closed for good, while others are mulling whether to shut down until spring. Advertisement “It’s going to be a long cold winter,” Franyo said. “I hope we all make it.” To help guide restaurants over the coming weeks, the City of Annapolis issued an executive order last month, allowing all businesses that have approved outdoor space to erect tents or other structures during the winter months. Executive Order No. 19, signed on Oct. 16 by Acting Mayor Elly Tierney, D-Ward 1, requires that businesses apply for Sidewalk Cafe Permits and/or a Recovery Zone application to be eligible.

(Pine Bluff Commercial/Byron Tate) Eleven downtown businesses got a big surprise in their Christmas stockings this year, thanks to a grant from Pine Bluff Downtown Development Inc. A total of $22,500 in grant money came from the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program and Main Street Arkansas. Joy Blankenship, executive director of downtown development, said the nonprofit, which focuses on the revitalization of downtown Pine Bluff, gets an annual grant for historic preservation, such as for signs or inside and outside facade work, but this year's was different. The agency got $7,500 more money than it normally gets, she said, and she was asked to do something with it that would alleviate some of the financial pain associated with the pandemic. That's when Blankenship came up with the idea to help the core businesses in downtown Pine Bluff with such things as paying rent or utilities and for covid-related expenses. All of the businesses in downtown development's program, which includes the area between Barraque Street and 10th Avenue and from Walnut to State streets, were eligible. Eleven businesses filled out the applications and all were approved, Blankenship said. Most asked for the full amount -- $2,400 -- she said, but some took less because they had received other covid-related government assistance and didn't need as much help."

Don’t count it out if the Eagles’ defense keeps this up | David Murphy Dealing with a fair share of injuries Sunday, the Eagles put together an impressive defensive effort to pull off a 24-21 upset against the Saints in Week 14. HEATHER KHALIFA / Staff Photographer We should not be having this conversation. I’ll be the first to acknowledge that. The Eagles are not a playoff team. At least, not in a holistic sense. If the NFL awarded its postseason spots to its 14 best teams, the Eagles would not be in the postseason. But that’s not how they award them. So don’t blame me for broaching the subject. As things stand, I would be derelict in my journalistic duty if I were to discuss the Eagles’ 24-21 win over the Saints on Sunday afternoon without noting that it dramatically increases the likelihood that you will be forced to devote at least one additional week of your life to this team. The pursuit of truth also compels me to note that you were probably scoffing at the mention of the playoffs at this time last year, as well as the year before. These post-Super Bowl Eagles teams have a certain fungus-like quality. They may not get better with age, but they do get more difficult to ignore. For the third straight year, you can’t count this team out, regardless of how that makes you feel. If the Eagles beat the Cardinals next week, and if Washington loses to the Seahawks, and if the Giants lose to the Ravens in Week 16, the Eagles would win the division at 7-8-1 by beating the Cowboys and Washington in their last two games. That’s a lot of ifs, but it says something that the Eagles’ own task at hand might face the heaviest odds. They don’t control their own destiny by any stretch of the imagination, particularly if that imagination accurately accounts for the level of play that we’ve seen from the Washington Football Team here lately. But the mere existence of a plausible path should give you a sense of the enormity of Sunday’s win."

The cases involving two other men - Indian national Rajendran Thiagarajan, 33, and Singaporean Lin Haifeng, 45 - are still pending. On Monday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Joseph Gwee said that on Sept 23, 2016, Newcon was awarded a contract to be the main building contractor of the Singapore Customs' COCC project.

Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla, who were members of her band, Selena y Los Dinos, before the group became known mononymously as Selena. Selena released her first single, “Contigo Quiero Estar,” with EMI Latin in 1989, but it was her 1992 smash hit, “Como la Flor,” that made her the Queen of Tejano music we remember today. The single peaked at number 6 on the U.S. Latin Chart. Afterward, Selena followed the song with hits like “Amor Prohibido,” “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” “No Me Queda Más” and “Fotos y Recuerdos,” which all reached number 1 on the U.S. Latin Chart. In 1994, Selena won her first and only Grammy for Best Mexican/American Album for her 1993 LP Live!. Selena died in March 1995 at the age of 23 when she was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldivar, her friend and the former president of her fan club. Saldivar was also the manager for her boutiques, Selena Etc. After her death, Selena’s family released her posthumous crossover album, Dreaming of You, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. Selena’s life and career have also inspired several TV shows and movies, most famously Jennifer Lopez’s 1997 film, Selena, and Netflix’s 2020 TV show, Selena: The Series, which stars The Walking Dead alum Christian Serrato as the late Tejano legend. “It was very sad too because she’s not here, and so it was those little moments, like, this was really cool and then you realize that she’s not here. She’s the one not part of this trio anymore,” Suzette, who is an executive producer on Selena: The Series, told Entertainment Tonight in 2020. “It had a lot of mixed emotions, if anything. I’m forever grateful and I’m grateful for the platform Netflix is able to give us, to be able to talk about this series. I don’t think that a lot of people realize that this type of platform is not given to everyone, especially us as Mexican-Americans.” What is Selena Quintanilla’s net worth? According to Celebrity Net Worth, Selena was worth $10 million at the time o her death in 1995. Her net worth included sales from her solo albums, 1989’s Selena, 1990’s Ven Conmigo, 1992’s Entre a Mi Mundo and 1994’s Amor Prohibido, as well as her posthumous LP released in 1995, Dreaming of You. Along with her music, Selena was also the founder of Selena Etc., a boutique in Corpus Christi, Texas. There were also plans for her to open another boutique in Monterrey, Mexico.

Northstar Wireless LLC and SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC won 43.5% of the wireless spectrum licenses up for bid in a 2015 government auction and had expected to use credits covering 25% of the $13.3 billion in bids. After a new review, the FCC said on Monday that “DISH Network continues to possess de facto control over SNR and Northstar.” DISH chairman Charlie Ergen said in a statement “the decision is a setback for an emerging competitor and we are disappointed.” The FCC first decided in 2015 that the firms, which were 85% owned by Dish, were ineligible for the small business credits. The discounts, up to 25% of the bidding costs, are aimed at helping new entrants compete. The FCC adopted new rules in 2015 to prevent companies from using similar tactics in future auctions."

Mo Brooks (R-AL) called into question the presidential election results and raised the possibility of House Republicans acting to ensure the will of the voters is acknowledged. The election has yet to be called for either incumbent President Donald Trump or Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as of Friday afternoon as a handful of states continue to count ballots. According to Brooks, the presidential election could be challenged on two grounds: that it did not occur on the day officially designated by the U.S. Congress and that there were possible fraudulent practices in place that undermined the election in favor of the Democrat candidates on the ballot. “Let me emphasize a preface to what I’m going to say next — the legal research is still being done by my office and others,” he said. “If something comes up that will change my mind, then I will change my mind. But right now, it’s important to understand what the United States Constitution says. The United States Constitution says that Congress shall set the time of these federal elections. Congress did that in Title 2, U.S. Code Section 7. We set a day — in this instance, November 3 as the day of the election. We did not set an election week. We did not set an election month. We did not set an election season. We set an election day.” “That’s when votes were supposed to be cast by people on that day, that 24-hour period with the exception of absentee ballots, where people who physically could not go to the polls to vote,” Brooks continued. “Every other vote is illegal. The en masse mail-in voting scheme that the Democrats have put forth does not comply with the federal law that set November 3 as the election day. That en masse voting scheme that the socialist Democrats put forth is an election season. Now for emphasis: If we let the socialist Democrats get away with stealing this election, with this enormous voting fraud, they will not only take the presidency, they will also take the United States Senate. We will lose it.” Brooks offered examples of possible election improprieties to bolster his claim that there could have been illegal practices that changed the election outcome. The Alabama congressman’s solution was for the House to not ratify the Electoral College results, which he said was within Congress’ constitutional purview, as opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court."

Gaetz argued the phenomenon called for a closer look, and he said among in-person voters that it was an “overwhelming landslide.” “I think you should extend information invitation to the inner-city African-American voters were uninspired by Barack Obama but then who leapt to the polls to vote for Joe Biden and to come on the show because I would, I like the president, want to meet these people,” he said. “I want to understand what was so deeply compelling about Joe Biden’s message because we didn’t really hear much of one at all. What we know is Donald Trump won an overwhelming landslide of the people who showed up and voted in person, whether that was on Election Day or during early voting.” “And then the farther the voter got away from the authentication process, the later the votes were counted, the better Joe Biden did with those voters,” Gaetz continued. “I think there’s a lesson here for Republicans to learn. If we allow the voting process to be separated from identification, authentication, audit and review, then we’re asking for these types of outcomes because when it comes to the people who have to show up in person and vote, this was a landslide for Donald Trump and everybody knows it.

That made him vulnerable to compromise. He could be blackmailed.

Few Americans have the cash they need on hand to pay for big-ticket items upfront. That's why it's not unusual for people to take out mortgages, car loans and student loans, so they can pay for these costly expenses over time. But when it comes to other major purchases — like home renovations, engagement rings, medical bills — an increasing number of Americans are turning to personal loans to help manage the cost. Personal loans are the fastest-growing debt category, according to a 2019 Experian study. While mortgages still made up the largest portion of consumer debt (71.7%), in 2019, Americans reportedly took out personal loans at a faster rate than auto loans, mortgages, credit cards and student loans. A form of installment credit, personal loans are sometimes used as an affordable alternative to credit cards because they generally charge lower interest rates. Personal loan APR averages 9.34% according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.6%. Unlike with revolving credit, you don't continue to have access to your loan once you pay it off — a plus for people concerned with getting in over their heads with spending."

Newly listed at almost $3.2 million, and tucked into a small gated enclave of a few dozen homes, all built in a similar cross-Mediterranean style, the roughly 6,200-square-foot manse presides over almost half an acre that backs up to the one of the tree-shaded fairways of the El Caballero Country Club. Tax records indicate Wayans paid $2.6 million for the five-bedroom and seven-bath home that is available through Geoffrey Gilstrap and Christopher De Bruno at Dwell California Real Estate & Investments.

A second-floor arched gallery overlooks the cavernous space that’s flooded with natural light all day long thanks to a Suburu-sized industrial skylight.

It seems to be resurfacing here in Chapter 2, perhaps permanently establishing our delicious mascots’ identities as “hunters”. Here’s where to ignite and dance near a Pizza Shrine in Fortnite. Really, it’s pretty simple, and it’s marked on your map. You’re headed either to the Pizza Truck or the Pizza Pit restaurant, which are here: Fortnite Credit: Epic Games The shrine you’re looking for is a kind of big, imposing cauldron with the Pizza Guy’s face of it and some sacks of tomatoes around. There’s one near the truck, and there’s one inside the restaurant. In both cases, all you’ve got to do is head over, light the thing on fire. Don’t forget to dance! I got confused, at first, and forgot to dance. One assumes there will be a similar burger challenge next week, and then perhaps some sort of climactic confrontation a little while later. Or not, the mascots are locked in eternal conflict here in the game, and no battle will ever be final. Wasn’t there also a taco restaurant in the game? It was actually sort of major in the old map, but it never really factored into this conflict. Which is off, when you think about it. We’re now halfway through the season, and smack in the middle of the Operation Snowmando set of challenges. Plenty to do in the game, especially for those choosing to stay home ."

[+] on November 19, 2020. - The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced on November 19, 2020, it will decommission the radio telescope following two cable breaks in recent months which have brought the structure to near collapse. (Photo by Ricardo ARDUENGO / AFP) (Photo by RICARDO ARDUENGO/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images To scientists and society at large, the collapse of the famous Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is a human tragedy, the loss of a powerful tool for space observation and an incredible monument to human capability. For children of a certain era, however, it’s impossible not to look at those wide shots of the platform above the giant dish and not remember Goldeneye 007. Goldeneye007 was a foundational first-person shooter on N64, with a kind of objective-based, non-linear design that was revolutionary at the time, in addition to fascinating little moments of stealth and one of the very first uses of location-based damage: for many gamers, likely their first encounter with the now ubiquitous concept of the headshot. Its split screen multiplayer mode was bedrock for just about every shooter that comes after, from Call of Duty to Halo. Goldeneye 007 was, of course, an adaptation of the film Goldeneye, which used the Arecibo Observatory in a stunning final scene. Both of them culminated at the bottom of the platform suspended over the center, with Bond delivering one of his all-time great killing quips before letting Sean Bean plummet to his death. I won’t type it, that’s lame, I’ll just put it down here: The scene is short in the movie, but its expanded into the level “Cradle” in the game. What’s amazing to me is that even now, looking at those wide pictures of the observatory, you can see the level clearly. You start out on the edges and run down a long bridge, doing your best to take out Trevelyan’s elite, ZMG-wielding forces: you’ve got to fire before you can see them, but the slope of the bridge makes it hard to miss."

Both the Xbox Series X+S and the PS5 are now firmly out in the wild, at least in North America, marking the dawn of a new console generation and continuation of a mad scramble to pick up what appears to be severely limited stock. So far, restocks and pre-orders have sold out instantaneously due to a combination of limited supply, massive demand, and the scalping bots and resellers that follow. Rest assured, if you want to buy one, you will be able to...eventually. It’s looking like these things will be a little tough to come by for a little while, however. So let’s talk about restock. When we were talking about pre-orders or launch-day allocations, it was pretty easy to predict your next chances to pick up a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Stock came in big waves, mostly the big one for pre-orders and launch day. Now that these things are released, it’s bound to be a little more scattershot, and not neccesarily limited to those big events. That stuff can be hard to see coming, but there is one of those big events coming in not too long. So far, we know that GameStop and Best Buy will have PS5/Xbox Series X+S stock on Black Friday, and I would assume that we’ll see similar notifications from other retailers once they release their Black Friday ads. Note that, despite Black Friday being a deals-focused holiday, we’re not expecting any discounts on these newly-released pieces of hardware. When new consoles are going for $1000 on eBay, however, MSRP starts to look like a great deal anyways. So keep an eye out for Thanksgiving, which is November 26, and Black Friday itself, which is November 27. In the US at least, I’d be pretty surprised if we saw substantial in-person options for this holiday, considering the lightning pace at which new coronavirus cases are climbing. Again, it will still be difficult to get your hands on one of these just due to the sheer scope of the demand. But this will likely be one of your better chances to do so, so be aware and stay on your toes.

They, and in particular their head coach, Wayne Pivac, needed victory, however ugly. As it is, the defeat condemns them, with only the sole victory over Italy, to their worst Six Nations campaign since 2007. And it hardly needs saying that that was before Warren Gatland took over. Wales under Pivac are not seeking to batter anyone but are learning the hard way that international rugby requires physical battles to be won before anything else can be achieved. Wales look a little lost at the moment, a little uncertain as to how they should be playing. Pivac is trying to re-educate a group of players who have been ingrained with a certain method. Times have changed. Pivac needs time but he will also need results to bide that time. Wales were flat and muddled, unable to break free or to subdue their opponents who won for the first time in Wales in 18 years. Wales lacked any assurance and direction as they slumped to their fifth successive loss, a pitiful state of affairs for a team that were the defending Grand Slam champions."

""I would like to encourage you in the strongest way to reclaim your personal integrity,"" read the missive from Timothy Powers, addressing those who may have participated in what faculty fear is a cheating scandal ""on a very large scale,"" per the Texas Tribune. It involves the Chegg tutoring website, which was found to have posted answers to entire exams online. Faculty at Texas A&M say they became suspicious after noting the finance students answered questions on their own online exams faster than they could have possibly read them. Powers tells the Tribune that Texas A&M saw a 20% or so increase in academic dishonesty reporting this semester compared with last fall. story continues below Other schools around Texas and the US have seen a similar spike in cheating reports, and Chegg has been specifically implicated, including at schools such as Boston University and Georgia Tech. Aggies interviewed by the Tribune say the temptation to use Chegg was exacerbated by the pandemic, which made it harder for them to seek out study partners or teacher aid. They also note it's a ""gray area"" in differentiating between using the computer for help and cheating. Powers scoffs at that excuse, noting that if students use actual test questions, ""they should realize this is inappropriate."" As for Chegg, the company says it will offer up user info to schools if cheating is suspected. Officials at Texas A&M, meanwhile, informed students that any who'd cheated had until Dec. 8 to turn themselves in; if they didn't and were later caught, the school could suspend or expel them.

So stoked we keep sending increasingly more advanced machines, like NASA's Perseverance rover, to search for evidence. A new study suggests we might need to take a much deeper look into the matter. A research team led by Rutgers University planetary scientist Lujendra Ojha examined a perplexing problem when it comes to the long-ago habitability of Mars: the paradox of the faint young sun. CNET Science From the lab to your inbox. Get the latest science stories from CNET every week. The sun wasn't always the perky ball of heat and light we know today. ""About 4 billion years ago, the sun was much fainter so the climate of early Mars should have been freezing,"" Rutgers said in a statement on Wednesday. That's a bit of mystery because we also see lots of signs of water in Mars' past. If it were warm and wet, Mars might have been habitable for microbial life. But how do we get meltwater with a faint young sun? The paper from Ojha and his colleagues, published in the journal Science Advances today, addresses this problem. ""I and my co-authors propose that the faint young sun paradox may be reconciled, at least partly, if Mars had high geothermal heat in its past,"" Ojha said. This is a phenomenon seen on Earth where decaying elements produce heat that can melt ice sheets from below. If Mars experienced similar conditions, that could explain liquid water despite the faint sun."

This will be the Czech beauty’s third child with her husband, Archie Drury; however, Kurkova writes about how different her experience growing her tiny human is this time around. The model begins by explaining that she accepts and welcomes the things she has no control over. “But being pregnant for the third time, and especially being pregnant during this time, is a different experience,” she wrote. “There’s the obvious—you don’t really get to experience it with your loved ones, you can’t see extended family, you go to ultrasounds by yourself.” However, her third pregnancy comes with many changes that are non-COVID related as well, specifically her journey with getting to know and falling in love with her new body. She added, “Twenty-one years of modeling, documenting my entire life in photographs, but I’ve never wanted to do pregnancy photos because I never felt beautiful showing my pregnancy belly. It’s sad when I think about it.” Kurkova continued to share how her time in the modeling industry has highlighted even the most “minor” of her insecurities. She was born three months early and had to have surgery as an infant to repair an umbilical hernia, this causes for her belly button to look more like a scar that what she calls a “normal belly button.” She said that her unique belly button became a target for vicious online trolls to bully her. While this was a source of her insecurity during her modeling years, it also played a part in how her she felt about her growing belly. “It also means that when I get pregnant, I have a flat spot—my belly doesn’t become perfectly round when my belly button grows, and I never wanted to show that,” Kurkova wrote. Of course, she recognizes that the damaging mentality of “the perfect body” stems from the industry she works in. In her essay for the outlet she recalled articles being written about her “missing belly button” while others called it “strange and alien.” But the problem wasn’t only critics online, but one she saw happen daily before her eyes. In photo shoots, she explained, “editors would retouch it, copying and pasting someone else’s belly button (I’d love to know whose) onto my body. Why would people do that?”"

Although many previous defense secretaries have served briefly in the military, only two—George C. Marshall and James Mattis—have been career officers. Marshall also served as secretary of state. Like Mattis, Austin would need to obtain a congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary since he has not been retired for the necessary seven years.

For the next 30 days, Chicken Soup has the right to pay cash in lieu of some or all of the preferred stock and the company said it has already determined that it will give Sony some amount of preferred stock. Sony had been widely expected to exercise its option. Despite rising valuations for AVOD services (Tubi and Pluto, for example, have been sold for mid-nine-figure sums), it appears that Sony did not see a comparable return on a business it entered more than a decade ago. In 2006, it paid $65 million for an emerging service called Grouper. After renaming it Crackle, Sony put an early stake in the streaming ground, mounting originals like Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee (which eventually decamped for Netflix). CSSE, which went public in 2017 and has a market value of about $247 million, has emerged as one of the largest ad-supported streaming players. It completed the Crackle deal last year as the AVOD market was heating up, and the coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated the broader shift of linear TV viewing to streaming, with advertising dollars following suit.

Ever since the expanding Universe was first discovered nearly 100 years ago, it’s been one of the biggest questions plaguing cosmology. If you can measure how fast the Universe is expanding right now, as well as how the expansion rate is changing over time, you can figure out everything you’d want to know about the Universe as a whole. This includes questions like: What is the Universe made of? How long has it been since the hot Big Bang first took place? What is the Universe’s ultimate fate? Does General Relativity always govern the Universe, or do we need a different theory of gravity on large, cosmic scales?"

Brexit: Peter Bone shuts down McDonagh over trade deal For months the key sticking points in the Brexit trade talks have been the same: fishing rights and common standards. As the negotiations reach their final state, though, it appears the latter, also known as the “level playing field”, might be the biggest stumbling block. Since the beginning of the talks, the EU has insisted that in order to have access to its single market, Britain needs to sign up to regulatory alignment, creating a ""level playing field"" on which EU member states and other countries can trade. Trending Downing Street has stood firm, insisting Brexit is about regaining sovereignty and to be able to set the UK's own rules, outside of EU regulations. The UK's chief Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost famously said regulatory divergence is “the point of the whole Brexit project” and anything less “simply fails to see the point of what we are doing"".

Among other revelations of plunging morale amongst the Masters of the Universe, the report includes the results of an internal poll of employees that found “only 51% of respondents said they believed that Facebook was having a positive impact on the world, down 23 percentage points from the company’s last survey in May.” BuzzFeed News recently published a report detailing the mood at Facebook in the 24 hours leading up to the U.S. Presidential election. In a note to Facebook employees titled “READY FOR ELECTION DAY,” the site’s vice president of global affairs and communications and the former United Kingdom deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, told employees: “We have transformed the way we approach elections since the U.S. presidential election four years ago. Thanks to the efforts of far, far too many of you to mention by name, Facebook is a very different company today.” However, many of Facebook’s employees did not seem to share Clegg’s positive opinion of the social media giant. BuzzFeed writes: Only 51% of respondents said they believed that Facebook was having a positive impact on the world, down 23 percentage points from the company’s last survey in May and down 5.5 percentage points from the same period last year. In response to a question about the company’s leadership, only 56% of employees had a favorable response, compared to 76% in May and more than 60% last year. (A Facebook employee acknowledged in the announcement that the uptick in May’s Pulse results were “likely driven by our response to COVID-19,” which was widely praised.) The external criticism leveled against Facebook for failing to completely stem hate and misleading information is weighing on employees. “Top constructive themes from comments mention decision-making related to hate speech and misinformation on our platforms, and concerns that leadership is focusing on the wrong metrics,” wrote a human resources leader in explaining the results. Employee performance at Facebook is often evaluated based on audience growth metrics, such as increasing the use of a new feature."

These results go against the conventional wisdom that the mountain of notifications generated on the average person’s phone every day distracts us from other tasks. Psych News Daily reports that a recent study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior on November 21 claims that 89 percent of smartphone interactions are initiated by users while only 11 percent are initiated by a notification. The study states: “The perceived disruptiveness of smartphones is not mainly driven by external notifications, but by an urge of the user to interact with their phone that seems to occur in an almost automatic manner, just as a smoker would light a cigarette.” The study followed the smartphone usage of people in the UK, Germany, and France. The average age of the subjects was 26 and just over half of the subjects were male. The study authors, Max Heitmayer and Saadi Lahlou, are both affiliated with the London School of Economics. The subjects were equipped with a tiny camera called “subcams” which filmed the subject’s daily lives from a first-person perspective. The subjects recorded their behavior for a total of around five hours over a three-day period. The subjects could turn the camera off at any time and were allowed to delete any footage they wished. The end result was around 200 hours of footage of user behavior in real-world environments. This totaled around 1,130 smartphone interactions that the researchers could analyze. The study found that the time between smartphone interactions was on average 291 seconds, meaning users were checking their phones around once every five minutes. The researchers noted that many users felt compelled to check their devices even when they had notifications switched off. One subject stated: “Seeing this has made me realize that I don’t even remember picking it up.”"

It’s a storytelling device, deliberately obscuring key information from the viewer to be revealed later for maximum dramatic effect. But it’s also a metaphorical device. In telling this story of the harshness of life in a part of Mexico, just south of the U.S. border, where militias and cartels rule the landscape and innocent people are “disappeared” forever, we’re seeing a place that most of us would rather not see. “Identifying Features” is this week’s free UW Cinematheque virtual screening. Email info@cinema.wisc.edu and put “IDENTIFYING FEATURES” in the subject line to get a free online link to watch. The film focuses on Magdalena (Mercedes Hernandez), a middle-aged mother in central Mexico who is distressed to hear that her baby-faced teenage son Jesus (Juan Jesus Varela), wants to illegally enter America to find work with his best friend Rigo. But she gives him what money she can, packs his bag and lets him make the dangerous trip north. Months later, with no word from the boys, Magdalena and Rigo’s mother (Laura Elena Ibarra) contact the police. Tragically, they find Rigo among photos of recently unearthed corpses. But there’s no concrete evidence of what happened to Jesus, although that bag Magdalena packed is found near a mass grave. Clinging to her last shred of hope, Magdalena heads north, hoping to retrace Jesus’ steps and find him, or at least find out what happened to him. It’s a path that crosses that of several characters, some more helpful than others, all scarred in some way by the violence in the region. A young man named Miguel (David Illascas), recently deported from the United States and heading south, offers the most assistance, and for a time they travel together as a makeshift mother-and-son. “Identifying Features” reminded me of the 1982 Costa-Gavras movie “Missing,” which follows American parents as they tried to discover what happened to their son, a journalist covering the 1973 military coup in Chile. Both films are structured like mysteries, with the protagonists following a trail of clues. But as they move forward into their investigations, they move deeper into the moral darkness of a country without mercy. One wonders if they really want the answers they’re looking for."

The London restaurant, which was opened in 1976 under then-co-owners Michael Caine and restaurateur Peter Langan, is understood to be relaunching next autumn. The Mayfair eatery, a favourite with boxer Muhammad Ali and The Rolling Stones lead man Mick Jagger, is believed to have been acquired by a group of individuals led by Oakley Capital founder Peter Dubens. The Mayfair eatery, a favourite with boxer Muhammad Ali and The Rolling Stones lead man Mick Jagger (pictured with Jerry Hall in 1983) It had closed in March following the coronavirus outbreak and did not reopen following the loosening of coronavirus restrictions earlier this year with staff retained under the government's Job Retention Scheme.

545,"Business and Finance, India","('-',)","The need for cleaner and cheaper fuel has continued to drive gas demand in the country, aiding prospects for city gas distribution companies or CGDs. The Air Quality Commission mandate that all industries operating in New Delhi must begin using piped natural gas by 31 January 2021 is expected to aid gas demand in the national capital region of Delhi (Delhi-NCR) further. Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), the CGD catering to Delhi-NCR, remains the key beneficiary. IGL is already in a sweet spot, with growth being led by rising compressed natural gas (CNG) demand from automobiles and piped natural gas (PNG) demand from households and industrials. Growing concerns over pollution in Delhi is leading to a further rise in industrial demand and will benefit IGL’s PNG volumes. IGL currently supplies PNG to about 5,566 industrial/commercial users. At least 1,644 industries and 50 industrial areas are being identified that need to switch over to PNG, which will benefit IGL, according to analysts. The same should also lead to earnings upgrades for IGL. The company’s FY22/FY23 volumes and earnings are expected to see an upside of 4%-5% and 8%-9% respectively, while net asset value (NAV) should rise by 8%-10% as per Morgan Stanley. Hence the prospects are brightening further. Growth is expected to be driven by higher conversion rate to CNG due to the BS-VI norms implementation, inter-city CNG travel and contribution from newer geographical areas. The firm is growing its Delhi-NCR network with expansions in Gurugram. Besides, medium-term drivers include expansions outside Delhi-NCR. IGL volume growth will see a boost also from expansion in new areas such as Rewari, Karnal and Muzaffarnagar; Haryana City Gas and the three newly-awarded geographical areas in the 10th round of bidding. These include Kaithal (Haryana), Ajmer, Pali, Rajsamand (Rajasthan), and Kanpur, Fatehpur, Hamirpur (Uttar Pradesh). The major overhang on rising competition post end of marketing exclusivities in certain areas has been resolved by the regulator. There is no threat of competition from oil marketing companies with whom IGL shares retail outlets. The company reported strong operating performance in Q2, and volumes have rebounded after the lockdown impact seen during April-May. Analysts expect volume to normalize by Q4. On the back of these developments, the stock has gained around 33% since October. It is trading at 26.3 times one-year forward earnings estimates. The valuations are at a significant premium over the long-term average of 18.3 times one-year forward earnings estimates. This shows that much of the positives have already been priced in."

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side required just a point from their final group stage match to seal a spot in the knockout stage but lost and will return to the Europa League in the new year. In the first half against Leipzig it was incorrectly claimed by the BT Sport commentator Darren Fletcher that United would've likely needed a favour from Istanbul Basaksehir against Paris Saint-Germain to go through after falling two goals behind in Germany. However, United were always going to be eliminated regardless of results elsewhere if they lost to Leipzig. That's because if two teams in the same group are level on points after all six games have been played, qualification is decided on head-to-head records before goal difference comes into the equation. United beat PSG 2-1 in Paris on matchday one but lost 3-1 at Old Trafford a week ago. Ultimately, Neymar's late goal in Manchester is the reason United don't have a slim chance of qualifying later tonight when PSG host Basaksehir in last night's rearranged match."

The company's Mate series phones are traditionally one of the top technologically based smartphones in the world each year. However, the powerful 5nm chips it designed for this year's Mate 40 line can no longer be shipped to the company because of a new U.S. export rule. The rule bans foundries like TSMC from shipping cutting-edge chips to Huawei without a license if said chips were produced using American technology. Huawei is arguably the most innovative company in the world this year An industry report cited by the South China Morning Post states that from the beginning of this year through the end of October, Huawei filed 8,607 patent applications related to wireless technology. That put the firm at the top of the pack, well ahead of San Diego, California based chip designer Qualcomm; the latter sought 5,807 patents during the same January to October time period. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Oppo was third with 5,353 patent applications. Database provider incoPat, headquartered in Beijing, is responsible for the data used to compile the list. Huawei is expected to be the leading provider of 5G base stations this year According to incoPat, both China and the U.S. led the way with each making up 32% of the patents filed from January through October. Japan was next with 15% followed by the 7% submitted by South Korea. IncoPat says that the information it uses comes from patent filings available to the public in the field of wireless communications. This includes patents filed to protect inventions related to 5G technology. The report issued by incoPat notes ""As a key area of modern communications, wireless communication network technology has always been a very important part in the 5G research and development process. With the new technological competition and new globalisation situation, wireless communication network technology is becoming an important strategic choice for enterprises to face international competition."" 5G is the next generation of wireless connectivity and the countries that control 5G will have an advantage economically. That is why, seeing how innovative Huawei is and not wanting to be left behind, back in June the U.S. Commerce Department amended the entity list ruling that prevents Huawei from working and doing business with U.S. based firms. Now, American tech companies are allowed to work alongside Huawei to help create global 5G standards. The U.S. feared that being left out of the meetings attended by Huawei would hold the U.S. back in terms of the development of 5G."

Mayor Khan made the comments in an interview with the anti-Brexit radio personality James O’Brien, welcoming the media-proclaimed but still contested victory of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the U.S. elections. “And it’s never been more hard to be a Muslim than the last four years. Why do I say that? Because you had, for the first time, the leader of the free world, the most powerful man in the world, a mainstream politician, perpetuating a view that Islam and the West are incompatible; perpetuating a view that all of us must be bad or must be terrorists because of the action of a very small minority,” Khan alleged. “And let’s be frank: the reason why I was singled out was not because of any other reason, in my view, and the view of experts, than my faith,” he claimed, not citing said experts. “[President Trump] brought into the mainstream those who were on the periphery, and it lead to Muslims around the world carrying an additional weight placed upon our shoulders by Donald Trump,” he went on, saying that similar burdens were placed on “those of Mexican origin… women, those from the LGBTQ+ community”. Some also disputed whether President Trump’s war of words with Khan could really be said to have no other reasonable motive besides anti-Muslim animus, given the leftist lobbied for the American leader to be denied a state visit and publicly denounced him in highly disparaging terms on multiple occasions."

The cut is now their second release to break into the top 10 on the Official Chart Company’s ranking of the most-consumed individual songs in the U.K. Until now, that’s a feat that only one other musical act from their home country had managed. BTS join Psy as the only two South Korean musical entities to place more than one song inside the top 10 on the singles chart, which has become increasingly competitive in the past several years. Psy helped kick off the current K-pop trend last decade when he dropped “Gangnam Style” onto an unexpecting world, and nothing has been the same since then. The super smash rose all the way to No. 1 in the U.K., and it remains the only song by a South Korean musician to rule the roost.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) AP Following the bizarre press event this week that saw Rudy Giuliani reference the movie My Cousin Vinnywhile hair dye streaked down his sweaty face, the Republican National Committee endorsed the wild statements Giuliani made during his lie-filled press conference, falsely claiming that Trump not only won the presidential election, but he did so in a “landslide.” The RNC left little doubt that the Republican party has gone full MAGA when it shared a video of one of the president’s lawyers, Sidney Powell, indignantly spreading misinformation about election fraud. Speaking as though she has truth on her side — she does not — Powell spoke of patriotism while telling lies that could ultimately damage the nation. “This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for people in this country to have participated in any way, shape or form. And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated,” Powell said. “American patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government. And we are going to take this country back. We are not going to be intimidated. We are not going to back down. We are going to clean this mess up,” Powell continued, “President Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it. And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.”"

Things have not been normal, not anything close. But there were enough games for the 6-1 Wildcats to begin shaping an identity, to begin defining roles and to begin preparing for the bulk of Pac-12 play that is scheduled to start Monday against Colorado (in a rescheduled game that was originally set for Dec. 2, of course). Here are five things that surfaced: 1. Jemarl Baker can shoot it in front of any backdrop When Baker led Arizona to a 75-72 win before Washington’s rowdy fans last season by scoring a then-career high of 17 points with 4-of-7 3-point shooting, including a go-ahead 3 with 44 seconds, it might have looked a little fluky. Baker shot just 26.3% from 3 during Pac-12 play last season and 34.3% overall. But the truth was this: Baker was playing all season with knee issues, he was handling both guard spots off the bench behind Nico Mannion, Josh Green and Dylan Smith — and he wasn’t needed to score as much with those guys around him. Everything has changed for Baker this season: He’s healthy, and he has been moved almost entirely off the ball and into a featured scoring role as the starting shooting guard. Without the still-ineligible Kerr Kriisa in the rotation, the Wildcats have leaned heavily on Baker to be their top 3-point shooter (45.5), although Bennedict Mathurin (7 for 16) and Terrell Brown (5 for 11) have carefully added to UA’s respectable 3-point shooting."

Production has wrapped on Mike Flanagan’s high-profile Netflix horror series Midnight Mass for Netflix. In a series of tweets early Wednesday, Flanagan announced the news, spoke about how the show was able to pull off an uninterrupted shoot of 83 days amid the pandemic and thanked his cast and crew. “That’s a wrap on MIDNIGHT MASS,” wrote Flanagan, who also directed all episodes. “It has been an extraordinary, unprecedented production, and I cannot be prouder of this amazing cast and crew. In fact – and I do not say this lightly – this has been the best production experience of my career.” As Deadline reported, Midnight Mass was the first U.S. series to start production in Vancouver in August, right after American studios reached agreements with the local unions over COVID protocols. The series did not have to shut down over Covid cases and also was not impacted by the backlog at a Vancouver lab that idled a number of U.S. productions in late September-early October. In Midnight Mass, starring Zach Gilford, Kate Siegel and Hamish Linklater, an isolated island community experiences miraculous events – and frightening omens – after the arrival of a charismatic, mysterious young priest. Related Story Read below Flanagan’s posts in a form of an emotional essay about Midnight Mass‘ journey from final pre-production in early March through a lengthy industry shutdown and an August restart to the successful completion of the season. He chronicles the challenges that cast and crew faced and how everyone adjusted to safety guidelines and frequent testing, keeping on-set interaction to a minimum, and how they finished a four-month shoot having never seen the faces of some of their coworkers below the eyes. “KN95 masks, face shields and hand sanitation became a way of daily life,” he wrote.” Having the swab stuck up our noses became normal. As time went on, we’d have thoughtful debates about which TYPE of swab we preferred.” We began prepping this series in December, 2019. We were mere days away from shooting when the production was shut down in March 2020 because of the pandemic. We left our sets standing, dropped everything and frantically got our cast and crew to their homes as the lockdown began."

Earning considerably more money in Turin, Pogba made 27 appearances in Serie A, played in the Champions League for the first time and won his first French cap. Juventus also won the league. So all in all it was a decent move and it is one that Raiola orchestrated. United didn't like it and Ferguson in particular blamed the agent for turning Pogba's face towards a different horizon. 'A bad agent,' is how he described him subsequently. Nobody knows what would have happened had Pogba stayed at Old Trafford. He may have been a success, he may have made a difference. Equally, he may have been caught up in the cycle and chaos of disappointment and bad football that followed Ferguson's decision to follow Pogba out of the door just a year later, in 2013.

""If you are disappointed with the government, blame the government, not the monarchy."" The royalists see the monarchy as central to Thai identity and have condemned the insolent language used by protesters on the institution they revere. Some 7km away, protesters rallied outside the headquarters of Siam Commercial Bank, 23 per cent of which is owned directly by King Vajiralongkorn. The monarch became a major landowner and shareholder of several Thai corporate giants in 2018, after he took personal ownership of the estimated US$40 billion worth of assets managed by the Crown Property Bureau, which controls property that belongs to the institution of the Thai monarchy. This fiscal year, almost 9 billion baht in the national budget has also been set aside for direct royal expenses. Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy. But protesters allege that the monarch - who commands two army units - exercises powers beyond the charter, and want his personal wealth to be separated from that of the Crown."

The MacOS backdoor provides the attackers with a window into the compromised machine, enabling them to snoop on and steal confidential information and sensitive business documents. The security company's researchers have linked it to OceanLotus because of the similarities in code and behaviour of the malware, compared with samples used in previous campaigns by the group. The attacks begin with phishing emails which attempt to encourage victims to run a Zip file disguised as a Word document. It evades detection by anti-virus scanners by using special characters deep inside a series of Zip folders. The attack could potentially give itself away if users are paying attention because when the malicious file is run, a Microsoft Word document doesn't appear. However, at this stage an initial payload is already working on the machine and it changes access permissions in order to load a second-stage payload which then prompts the installation of a third-stage payload - which downloads the backdoor onto the system. By installing the malware across different stages like this OceanLotus aims to evade detection. Like older versions of the malware, this attack aims to collect system information and creates a backdoor allowing the hackers to snoop on and download files, as well as upload additional malicious software to the system if required. It's thought that the malware is still actively being developed."

The decision provided a window of time after Election Day, when the preliminary results were announced, in which unscrupulous actors could attempt to influence a close Presidential election in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.” The power to regulate election procedure lies with the state legislatures, not the court, as the Attorneys General point out: “As with other separation-of-powers provisions in the Constitution, the Election Clauses’ explicit allocation of authority to state legislatures to regulate federal elections is a structural check on governmental power that preserves liberty. Encroachment on this authority by another state actor undermines the specific design for separation of powers in the Constitution. The violation of separation of powers in this case threatens the liberty of all Americans, not just Pennsylvanians. And it diminishes one of their most precious liberties—the right to vote for President of the United States.” The Trump campaign and the Pennsylvania Republican Party are continuing the fight in court, hoping that the Supreme Court will rule the mail-in ballots received after election day as illegitimate."

Deepening contraction in core sector growth comprising eight infrastructure sectors in October, after nearing the zero mark in September, had raised questions on the sustainability of the normalization process in the economy. Data released by analytics firm IHS Markit on Tuesday showed Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector fell to a three-month low at 56.3 from an over 12-year high of 58.9 in October but still remained in expansion territory. A reading above 50 separates expansion from contraction. Separately, finance ministry data showed goods and services tax (GST) revenue of the central and state governments touched ₹1.05 trillion for the second month in a row, growing 1.4% from the revenue collected in the year-ago period, after the sharp decline in the initial months following the nationwide lockdown. After showing year-on-year contraction in the April to August period, GST receipts showed a positive trend in September, which got pronounced in October, indicating the economic recovery is in line with the lifting of lockdown restrictions. Pollyanna De Lima, associate economics director at IHS Markit, said the softening of rates of expansion seen in the latest month does not represent a major setback, since these are down from decade-plus highs in October, a spike in covid-19 cases and the possibility of associated restrictions undermining the recovery. “For now, firms are projecting sustained demand growth in the near term and responded to this by lifting input buying to increase their safety stocks. Employment remained in contraction territory, with companies reportedly keeping the minimum possible number of workers as per government guidelines,"" she added. Out of the ₹1.05 trillion revenue collected in November, central GST is ₹19,189 crore, state GST is ₹25,540 crore, IGST is ₹ 51,992 crore, and cess is ₹8,242 crore.

Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP The investment company run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett bet $5.7bn (£4.3bn) on pharmaceutical companies during the third quarter of 2020, as the sector takes centre stage in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Berkshire Hathaway bought shares in drug companies AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Pfizer between July and September, according to filings with the US regulator. Share purchases by Buffett, known as the “Sage of Omaha”, are heavily scrutinised because of his long record of delivering strong returns for investors. That record has made the 90-year-old the world’s sixth richest person, with a net worth of $88bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The investment company, which is based in Omaha, the largest city in Nebraska state, has struggled during the pandemic, with investments such as Buffett’s major bet on the US airline industry hit. Shares in Berkshire Hathaway have gained 3.7% during 2020, lagging behind the broad S&P 500 index of US stocks, which is up 12%. Buffett’s bet on the US pharmaceutical industry is likely to be seen as another boost for the sector as it takes centre stage in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. US pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna, the latter not among Berkshire Hathaway’s new investments, have published preliminary findings suggesting that their vaccines against Sars-CoV-2 are both more than 90% effective. The vaccine news added further positive momentum to global stocks, which have defied the huge economic costs of lockdowns triggered by the pandemic to rise during the course of 2020."

Washington (6-7) has won four straight games and is one game ahead of the New York Giants, who lost to the Arizona Cardinals 26-7 earlier Sunday. It is Washington's first four-game winning streak since 2016. Washington can thank its young, impressive defense for this win. The team took a 13-7 lead at halftime after Young scooped up a fumble, shook off a tackle and ran 47 yards down the left sideline for a touchdown with 1:11 left in the second quarter. It was Young’s first professional touchdown. Even at 264 pounds, the No. 2 overall pick easily outran the San Francisco offense into the end zone, palming the football in his left hand as he cruised past the pylon.

675,"U.S., Weather","('-',)","Week ahead: Rainy Monday before Wednesday winter storm The National Weather Service's early snowfall projection map for Wednesday suggests 3-6-inch totals will be possible in the New River and Roanoke valleys with less to the south and more to the north. This map does not include any ice accretion from freezing rain that may occur. Shifts up or down with snowfall are still very possible as the storm is more than 48 hours away, but it looks exceedingly unlikely that the region will miss wintry precipitation altogether. Another inch or two of rain is on the way Monday, which will move Roanoke closer to what now appears likely to be the wettest year on record. But let's fast-forward past that to what most people in and near the Roanoke/New River valleys will be thinking about regarding weather this week. The region's first widespread, significant winter storm event in 22 months looks very likely to occur on Wednesday, with the potential for multiple inches of snow and/or significant icing. Travel hazards are likely to develop, with some chance for at least scattered power outages. ""All rain"" looks to be off the table for the Wednesday event and ""all snow"" almost as unlikely, leaving a whole range of wintry mixture combinations in between. We still have a couple of days to get a better idea of whether we're talking about a lot of snow with a little ice, a little snow with a lot of ice, or something in between. A reasonable early middle ground based on forecast model runs suggests a 2-4 or 3-6 inch type snow capped by sleet and perhaps up to a quarter-inch of glaze ice in the Roanoke and New River valleys. Ice will be more significant to the south and east, snow will be heavier to the north -- this might turn into a foot-plus storm in parts of Northern Virginia and extending northeast from there. The atmospheric feature that makes Wednesday's event appear so iron-clad to be wintry is cold air damming, as high pressure over southeast Canada and to some extent the backside rotation of the low causing Monday's rain press cold air southward east of the Appalachians, trapping cold air in place as Gulf of Mexico moisture arrives ahead of the next low pressure system."

But that practice apparently ended around 2012. Now, the empire is poised to strike back, as a group action by authors of the Star Wars adaptations and other franchises are going public. They claim that Disney has refused to pay royalties on book contracts since it absorbed Lucasfilms in 2012 in a $4 billion deal, according to a Wall Street Journal report. These writers say Disney has either delayed dealing with their complaints or stiffed them on checks that rarely total a few thousand bucks apiece. And the Star Wars franchise isn’t the only source of trouble. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America association claims other authors of books tied to projects from Indiana Jones to Buffy the Vampire Slayer came forward with similar stories of non-payment, all under similar circumstances to the Star Wars issue. Once Disney acquired the properties, the checks were no longer in the mail. The WSJ report says divining how much money may be owed is complicated, as sales and royalties for the books involved have fluctuated wildly over time. A Disney spokesman told the WSJ, “We are carefully reviewing whether any royalty payments may have been missed as a result of acquisition integration and will take appropriate remedial steps if that is the case.”"

O’Brien landed in Hanoi on November 20 as part of a tour of Asia and met with a series of officials the next day before leaving for the Philippines. During the visit, O’Brien’s Vietnamese hosts made every effort to keep the delegation isolated, Bloomberg said, ensuring that their exposure to others was minimized. All of those on the trip were tested for the coronavirus upon arrival, with the authorities conducting the tests wearing “head-to-toe protective gear,” Bloomberg said. Members of O’Brien’s delegation were also said to be housed in rooms on the same floor of the Metropole hotel â€” where President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February 2019 â€” with hotel staff leaving the team’s meals “outside the US guests’ doors,” the report said. Vietnamese officials also did not permit the US Air Force crew in charge of O’Brien’s plane to pass customs and enter Vietnam, leaving them to fly to Thailand and wait until O’Brien had finished his trip, Bloomberg reported.

Maradona, who died on Wednesday at his home in Argentina following a heart attack, met the pope several times at the Vatican after Francis was elected in 2013 as Latin America’s first pope. “The pope was informed about the death of Diego Maradona, he recalls the times he met him in these past years with affection, and he is remembering him in his prayers, as he did in the past days when he was informed about his condition,” Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. Francis is a lifelong fan of the Buenos Aires San Lorenzo soccer team. The official Vatican News website ran a story of Maradona’s death on its front page with a headline calling him “soccer’s poet”. It called Maradona “an extraordinary player but a fragile man,” a reference to his struggle with drugs. Maradona travelled to Rome several times to take part in several benefit games called “Matches for Peace,” whose proceeds went to a papal charity for education in developing countries and for victims of the 2106 earthquake in central Italy."

700,"Energy, Environment, Science, Travel","('-', 'Content Source Geo', 'Country')","Earlier this week the Kīlauea volcano on Hawai'i’s Big Island—one of the world's most active volcanoes—erupted for the first time in more than two years. During the last few weeks, the United States Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory detected more frequent mini earthquakes and movements beneath the volcano, signaling that something was stirring underground. Finally, on Sunday night, the observatory detected a glow in the Halema‘uma‘u crater at the volcano's summit. Then, the crater's walls started to crackle as sizzling lava emerged from fissures and trickled into the water-filled crater below, reports Jeanna Bryner for Live Science. Earlier this year scientists discovered that water has been pooling in the Halema‘uma‘u crater since July 2019. They predicted that this new pond could ultimately lead to more explosive eruptions in the future because when lava meets water, it causes steam and pressure builds up and can spark a more powerful reaction. That's exactly what happened on Sunday night. Lava emerged from fissures and flowed down into the crater until the water boiled off, which turned the night sky into a bright, fiery swirl of gas, ash and steam. One fissure even shot a lava fountain 165 feet up in the air, reports Live Science. Ultimately, what was once a lake of water turned into a newly formed lava lake, according to the Weather Channel. Around an hour after Kīlauea erupted, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake rocked the southern part of the volcano. Then the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a red alert, meaning that an eruption is imminent, Jaclyn Diaz reports for NPR. The Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency later ordered residents to stay inside to avoid the falling ash, which can irritate eyes and lungs, reports Dharna Noor for Gizmodo. But by Monday afternoon, the danger had waned, and the alert was taken down a level, according to the Weather Channel. “The lava seems to be decreasing, but the emission of steam and gases from the crater remains the same,” Cyrus Johnasen, a spokesman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, tells Christine Hauser of the New York Times. “The lava is not moving anywhere. [The agency was still] monitoring air quality, and that is basically the only thing that is of immediate concern at this time.” Kīlauea's latest eruption poses little risk to the public—though it is still ongoing—because the lava pooled in the crater instead of flowing down the mountain, reports Caleb Jones for the Associated Press. In comparison, when Kīlauea erupted in 2018, it spewed 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of lava that flowed for four months, destroying more than 700 homes."
701,Technology,"('-', 'Consumer Electronics', 'Smartphones', 'Technology & Computing')","Here's how the big-battery Moto G9 Power will look Even though Motorola barely unveiled the low-cost Moto G9 Play a couple of months ago, a significantly sleeker G10 Play model with a trendy hole punch design and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner might already be right around the corner. Before moving to the Moto G10 family, however, you'd expect the Lenovo-owned company to complete the G9 lineup first, and that's precisely what we think is about to happen any day now. Specifically, the big-battery Moto G9 Power is likely to be officially announced and commercially released at some point before Christmas after having many of its key specifications leaked last week. Speaking of notches, there won't be one on the G9 Power, which shouldn't come as a surprise for those familiar with the design of the early 2020-released G8 Power, aka Moto G Power. Interestingly, the hole punch screen is purportedly set to grow in size from 6.4 to 6.78 inches while losing in quality due to a resolution downgrade from 2300 x 1080 to 1640 x 720 pixels. Clearly, Motorola wants to keep the price point as low as possible, and with the extra screen real estate and a battery capacity upgrade from 5,000 to 6,000mAh, the easiest way to do that must have been settling for an inferior pixel count. The same cannot be said about the primary rear-facing camera, mind you, which is expected to go from 16 all the way up to 64 megapixels, while the selfie shooter should retain its 16MP count. The specs of the other two imaging sensors found on the back of the G9 Power are not etched in stone yet, but previous reports called for modest-sounding 2MP depth and macro lenses. With a rear-mounted fingerprint reader, 4 gigs of memory, 128 gigs of internal storage space, and a more than respectable 20W charger included in the retail box as standard, the Moto G9 Power is tipped to cost €250 or so when it eventually goes on sale in Europe, which means its recommended price could be set at around $250 in the US... provided the phone is in fact headed that way."

Here's the best of the subscription-based VoD TV packages. A few years ago, only hardcore techies and television fans were cord-cutting. Today, there are more people watching streaming shows than there are paying for cable or satellite TV. There are three reasons for this shift. First, the best live TV streaming services now offer pretty much anything you'd ever want from a traditional TV service. Second, even though live TV streaming services costs are catching up with cable, for now, they're still more affordable. Finally, the video-on-demand (VoD) services, which started the cord-cutting revolution, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, are now more likely to produce ""much watch"" TV than their older competitors. For example, CBS All Access's Star Trek: Discovery; Disney Plus's The Mandalorian; and Netflix's The Queen's Gambit all have huge audiences and are popular with the critics as well. Today, with the exception of HBO, which has its own streaming specific service now, HBO Max, you're more likely to find the show you want to watch on a streaming service than on antenna, cable, or satellite. But, which service is right for you? Before describing them, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention there are numerous free VoD services.

They have been featured in a range of exhibitions, including the 2003 showcase “1950/2000 Theater of Italian Creativity” curated by architect Gae Aulenti in New York, and most recently in “Playground — The Design of Sneakers,” an exhibit at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Bordeaux, France. The sneakers stemmed from an intertwining personal passion and entrepreneurial intuition. As the story goes, in the afternoon of Feb. 3, 1997, Prada’s co-chief executive officer Patrizio Bertelli, an avid sailor, had a conversation with yacht designer Gérman Frers, and made a pledge to partake in the 2000 edition of the America’s Cup challenge for the first time."

Take Richard “Ricky Hil” Hilfiger, the second of Tommy Hilfiger’s four children. Though the tatted-up rapper has taken a remarkably different professional path than his veteran designer dad — who remains primarily known for his classical, categorically preppy apparel creations — the younger Hilfiger appears to know artful architecture when he sees it, having paid $1.8 million for a striking home in the semi-remote, wilderness-adjacent L.A. County neighborhood of Topanga. Though Hilfiger’s new house has more than a whiff of midcentury modern in its bones, tax records show the long and narrow abode was actually built in 1995. Tucked into a thrilling hairpin curve on a two-lane mountain road, the one-acre property clings to a steep ridge and offers a gravel motorcourt with space for at least a half-dozen cars, plus a detached two-car garage with upstairs guest quarters. The nearly 2,500-square-foot structure itself is perhaps best described as bunker-like, though the forbidding architecture belies airy interiors that are flooded with natural light, thanks to big walls of glass and long ribbons of clerestory windows. The front door opens immediately into the spacious living room, which is divided from the adjoining den by a fireplace and enormous bookcase. Both spaces have what the listing describes as “breathtaking vistas,” over the ruggedly beautiful Santa Monica mountains. On the opposite side of the living room lies an industrial-chic kitchen warmed by cherry wood cabinetry. Like all rooms in the house, the kitchen sports matte-finished concrete floors for natural cooling, and the space spills out to an informal dining room and covered loggia that connects the main house to the guesthouse, where there’s a bedroom suite tucked above the aforementioned garage. The main house also offers two bedrooms, one of them tucked a semi-subterranean basement affair that could easily be converted into a music studio, gym, or lavish home office. Outside, the property’s terraced backyard overlooks the desolate landscape; patios hewn from decomposed granite offer ample space for al fresco entertaining."

The latest round of restrictions for travelers are set to start on Kauai on Wednesday, when the island will require a 14-day quarantine for all arriving passengers who aren’t essential workers after county leaders opted out of the state pre-travel testing program. But the combination of Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami’s decision and Governor David Ige’s move to prevent passengers arriving in Hawaii without test results in hand from participating in the state’s pre-travel testing program have brought a new suggestion from health and business leaders. The House Committee on COVID-19 suggested Monday that travelers who comply with the 72-hour pre-travel testing process, but don’t have a result in hand prior to boarding the plane, should be able to take an arrival test and remain in quarantine until they have the results from both the mainland and arrival test. That way, travelers who don’t have a full 14 days to spend in quarantine would not be as disincentivized from flying to Hawaii. Mufi Hanneman, president and CEO of the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Industry, says the governor’s new policy is discouraging travelers to visit the state."

Warnock hopes to oust Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) during the January Senate runoff. Warnock has defended Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s “God Damn America” sermon and called Wright a “prophet.” Warnock also compared law enforcement to gangsters, thugs, and bullies during a speech in 2015: Cotton said in a statement Friday that Democrats have nominated a “radical” to challenge Loeffler for her U.S. Senate seat. “Raphael Warnock compared police in Georgia to ‘gangsters’ and ‘thugs,’” Cotton said. “Our men and women in blue protect us from crime every day, and the fact that Georgia liberals have picked someone so radical to lead their party shows how out of touch they are with the average American.” The Georgia Senate runoff between Warnock and Loeffler serves as a pivotal race for control of the U.S. Senate majority. Warnock’s potential victory over Loeffler would allow the Georgia Democrat, who has praised Marxism as a way to “teach the black church,” to hold significant influence in Congress’s upper chamber. “I’m reminded of Sen.

Then, the Cardinals (19-4) got two blasts from Lindsey Magaw to win the final three points to secure the match. “We had a lot of unforced errors, and that’s not at all how we normally play,” Jaguars coach Danny Tullis said. “Credit Sacred Heart for forcing us into some of those mistakes. Our effort was there, but our confidence and cohesiveness was not. And we didn’t serve the ball well. We can’t make those mistakes and come back against a good team.” In her final appearance in a Pope John Paul II uniform, Hartmann finished with a match-high 33 kills, which was 13 more than Magaw and 19 more than MVP May Manning. ""Obviously, it was a devastating loss, but this whole season was extremely fun, and I am excited we were even able to make it back to the state finals,"" Hartmann said. ""Four months ago, we didn't even know what we were doing. We were just throwing people in different places, because we didn't know how we would even work together (because of coronavirus restrictions)."""

Munn’s festive sweater arrives ahead of the January 5 Senate runoff elections in Georgia, which could make Kamala Harris one of the most powerful vice presidents in American history should the Democratic candidates, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win the two Senate elections next month. Georgia is the epicenter in the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C. If Democrats win the two races in Georgia, the Senate will be split 50-50, giving a future Vice President Harris the power to cast the tie-breaking votes, handing over control of the Senate to the Democrats. Last month, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” Some of the issues Harris will be able to cast tie-breaking votes on include far-left cabinet nominees, ending the filibuster to allow Democrats to push through their far-left legislative agenda with a simple majority vote, and the AOC’s Green New Deal, and amnesty, among many other issues. With the loss of the two Senate seats in Georgia, a Vice President Harris could also cast a tie-breaking vote to rescind President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, as well as establish universal mail-in voting and other fraud-friendly “election reform.”"

In a written judgment, Justice Choo Han Teck said: ""Dr Foo, who may well be a competent general surgeon, was not adequately trained to perform the liposuction and fat transfer procedures. ""Unfortunately, Dr Foo believed himself capable and thus did not manage this case as a competent surgeon in this field should have done."" The court also found that Dr Foo's delay in sending for an ambulance after Madam Yeong collapsed at his clinic was an act of negligence. Dr Foo initially deflected liability by blaming the doctors at the Singapore General Hospital's accident and emergency department for failing to resuscitate her, but dropped his case against the hospital doctors midway through the trial.

I know the team’s four-game losing streak has been tough to endure, but at least there’s some intrigue, right? For the fourth week in a row, the Eagles have a tough matchup against a playoff team, this time vs. the New Orleans Saints.

Currently in beta, the interface allows you to virtually navigate a ""physical"" library. The project comes from Internet Archive — a non-profit website that gives you access to free music, books, websites, software, and more. But as part of its Open Library platform (which offers access to a catalogue of millions of ebooks), Library Explorer is meant to elevate the experience of simply searching for books by scrolling through a web browser. When you're on the Library Explorer page, you'll see tall bookshelves that you can click on. As with any local library, it leverages the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classification systems. So, it allows you to easily search for a specific book you're looking for, while also potentially discovering something new. At the same time, you can also use smart filters based on your interests. So, you can do things like personalize single rows of books, expand shelves, or curate the experience based solely on your interests. For example, when clicking on the ""juvenile"" filter, the entire library will transform into books for children. If you click on the ""biography"" filter, you'll strictly see titles of biographies. You also have the ability to customize the look and feel of the library via the Settings menu. When you click on the tab, you can opt to see the books in 3D and choose between the classification systems you want the books organized in. But one thing Library Explorer doesn't do is feed you an algorithm. Unlike Netflix and YouTube, which show you recommendations based on past content you've watched and searched for, this portal pushes you to find things on your own. That way, you have more opportunities to stumble upon books outside of your bubble."

Biden has said he wanted to prioritize healthcare workers and vulnerable people in the inoculation process, adding that he did not “want to get ahead of the line”, but hoped to “demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take”. Coronavirus vaccinations began in nursing homes yesterday, where the virus has killed more than 110,000 people in the US. However, there are concerns the vaccine rollout may be delayed, as the US faces a powerful winter storm that is battering states from Virginia to Massachusetts. The National Weather Service said snow, flooding and even tornadoes could hit parts of the eastern US, threatening transport used to distribute the vaccine from its manufacturing sites in Michigan. In better news, the coronavirus vaccine supply could increase by 40% after the US Food and Drug Administration announced that extra doses contained in Pfizer’s vials can be used. Pharmacists discovered that some of the bottles contained enough liquid for two extra doses. The scheme to get Covid vaccines to poorer countries is at “very high” risk of failure, and could leave billions of people with no access to the vaccine until 2024, internal documents from the scheme have shown.

Here, Greg Thomsen, an outdoor industry veteran and the chief outdoor officer at Adidas Outdoor, Agron, shares some of the latest trends he sees emerging in the sector: • Utilitarianism: It’s escapism that manifests itself in the outdoor industry. Consumers can wear one thing that serves 10 different purposes. It’s the trend of simplicity and less clutter. • Outside is safer: The sovereignty of individual choice is key. Consumers want to have control over what they do. People don’t want to be inside. • Backcountry trends: It’s really interesting how many people were heading into the backcountry this year. With parks, campgrounds, and public spaces filled up, a lot of people put in the effort to backpack, bikepack, or just do longer, out-of-the-way adventures. I think we’ve seen that reflected in gear sales. • Riding bikes: Of course, it was great to see the bike industry surge this year, perhaps more than any other space in our outdoor world. It’s not so unique, but it’s a good story. What would be unique is if it continues into next year. • Working together: While it feels like there have been more announcements lately in the industry, it seems to really be focused on partnerships, advocacy efforts, collaborations, virtual engagement, and less about a new product. So that’s not really a unique trend, but it also seems to be where brands have shifted their efforts in these times. Maybe it’s budget-related, or an outcome of our changing social climate, or because this reset has allowed companies to refocus their mission/priorities. Who knows!"

838,Arts and Entertainment,"('-', 'Books and Literature')","Black cowboys inspired legends in the South. Why are they portrayed as overwhelmingly white? When you see Black men riding their horses down Cullen or in Acres Homes, what do you think of? For many, the first answer to pop up in their mind isn't that it's historic or a callback to the past of the Houston region, when Black cowboys flourished here. That's because the U.S. South's history of Black cowboys has been sorely minimized and misrepresented in American culture, leaving the stories of Black icons untold and their accomplishments unsung. In fact, according to Larry Callies, the owner of the Black Cowboy Museum in Rosenberg, Texas, and a cowboy himself, cowboys originated right in our backyard — in Fort Bend and other surrounding counties. Smithsonian Magazine reports that one in four cowboys was Black. So why don’t we know more about them? While Hollywood tells a whitewashed story of who cowboys were, the real history exists in the folklore told about famous Black cowboys like Nat Love and Bill Pickett. These men were famous because of their amazing skill and ingenuity. Bill Pickett invented ""bulldogging,"" a rodeo technique to wrestle a steer to the ground, and Nat Love trained himself to become an expert marksman and cowboy, for which he earned the moniker ""Red River Dick,"" according to historical information from the Black Cowboy Museum."

In the recent annual Combat Readiness Week, Republic of China (RoC) armored units were spotted on the streets of Taipei as usual. This time though they were trying to blend in with the cityscape disguised as construction vehicles, scrap heaps and other urban features. A spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense told a press conference that this year the armored brigades were experimenting with new approaches to combat concealment, using camouflage netting and borrowing features of urban scenery to improve their survivability. The old military saying, “if we can see it, we can hit it; if we can hit it, we can kill it,” has never been truer than with modern precision weapons. While invisibility may not be possible, being less obvious and being able to see the enemy before they see you is a key to survival. Several images released by Youth Daily News, the Ministry of Defense’s media outlet, show CM-32 Clouded Leopard armored vehicles disguised as bright yellow construction vehicles. The CM-32 is an infantry fighting vehicle, armed with a 30mm cannon and carrying eight passengers, with a role similar to the U.S. M2 Bradley. Rather than making something the size of a truck disappear, the RoC Army effectively turned them into civilian vehicles with a combination of cloth and yellow-painted wooden boards. A tank concealed in a junkyard with metallic grey sheeting and scrpt metal Youth Daily News Other images show a main battle tank, possible a CM-11 Brave Tiger, concealed in a junkyard. Rather than the usual camouflage netting it is draped in shiny grey material with strategically-placed pieces of scrap metal, completely breaking up the outline of the tank. This is similar to the normal approach used to camouflage tanks, except that the method usually involves branches and other vegetation; the same hermit-crab principle of borrowing from the surroundings work just as well here."

Coaches are also examining why their team wasn’t mentally prepared last Saturday against Illinois. But coach Scott Frost declared that the tension between the long-term future of the program and short-term urgency to win games is most pointed at quarterback. “There’s no doubt in my mind Luke McCaffrey is the future around here,” Frost said. “But right now, to help us win, we gotta play the guy that gives us the best chance.” McCaffrey, a redshirt freshman who made his second career start last weekend, was electric in the run game but threw three interceptions and lost a fumble. Martinez — who came off the bench Saturday for the first time in 24 career appearances — has completed barely 58% of his passes and endured his own issues with ball security. Neither quarterback has unlocked the downfield passing game. Frost said he’s “not sure” who the QB will be Friday when the Huskers battle Iowa on the road, but he's confident in both. Frost was asked Monday about quarterbacks he's recruited or coached in the past — Marcus Mariota and Justin Herbert at Oregon, McKenzie Milton at Central Florida — and he said McCaffrey and Martinez have that same level of potential. “They both have enough talent to be those guys,” Frost said. “We haven’t gotten them playing there yet.”"

'It's one of those influences that isn't very obvious,' she says Phoebe Bridgers was in grade school in Pasadena, California, when she heard Metallica’s music in the PlayStation 2 game Test Drive: Off-Road Wide Open. “I was a kid in the early 2000s, so it was kind of a gift when a band that you just got into has an entire catalog already,” says Bridgers, 26. “You get to go back and listen to everything.” Though Bridgers has credited artists like Elliott Smith and Tom Waits as influencing her deeply emotional folk-rock sound, she’s been less vocal about her fandom for Metallica; she’s the kind of fan who can make an impassioned case for 2003’s St. Anger. “I think of Metallica as being a pop band,” she says. “A lot of metal is just metal to be metal — but Metallica write real songs.” Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, 56, was excited when Bridgers reached out for a conversation, delving into her catalog, even her previous bands Einstein’s Dirty Secret and Sloppy Jane. The talk flows so easily, in fact, that nearly two hours had passed when Ulrich finally looks at the clock. “I could sit here and talk all day,” he says. “This is supercomfortable.” Bridgers: You have great fans, but you also have fans that are pretty entitled and have ownership over you and are like, “These are the real Metallica records.” What do you make of that? Related Ulrich: The difference now, compared to back in the day, is that everybody’s got an opinion. In the mid-to-late Nineties, it was like, “We played a show four days ago in Bumfuck, Somewhere, and the set list is posted online. The whole Napster thing 20 years ago, when we woke up in the middle of that shitstorm, was the first time where we were not universally the good guy. That’s when I conditioned myself to stop paying attention [to online commentary]. Bridgers: The Napster thing is so interesting to me because we’re sitting in 2020 and somebody who doesn’t play music at all is making all the money on streaming. Now it’s legal to steal records. I know it must’ve been so traumatic to get torn apart, but in retrospect, are you ever just like, “Fuck that, I can’t regret having that stance”?"

In a year where so many people have faced financial hardships because of the COVID-19 pandemic, luxury gifts are probably far from the minds of regular folks. But for the billionaires who have gotten richer during the pandemic, Neiman Marcus’s Fantasy Gifts don’t seem too out of reach. And that’s who these gifts are for — Neiman Marcus focuses on the nation’s top two percent as its target market. But those of us who can’t afford a $345,000 Alaskan getaway are stuck looking at the fantasy gifts from afar and soaking in the sweet satire of our reality. Anyway, here are some of the wildest Fantasy Gifts from the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book 2020 to work up your appetite for eating the rich: This year's Fantasy Gifts are focused on self-care because Neiman Marcus knows how tough 2020 has been. That's why the retailer is offering a wellness package that costs the same as a nice five-bedroom house in the Midwest. This gift includes a seven-night stay at a Canyon Ranch resort, followed up with three weeklong checkups and monthly virtual consultations. The resort is, of course, all-inclusive. We wouldn't expect anything less. I have never in my life even thought about spending $95,000 on a piece of clothing, let alone a hat. (Granted, I am not rich.) But for people who really shell out for their fits, these custom hats are from a collection designed in collaboration with icons like Run-DMC. Don't worry, for almost $100,000 you get more than just the hat — you also get signature hat boxes and custom display cases. Definitely worth the money. Just as Michael Scott thought he was supposed to spend three years' salary on an engagement ring, Neiman Marcus thinks dishing out about that much for a fashion ring is attainable. The Oscar Heyman collection is made up of beautiful one-of-a-kind rings featuring exotic gems. I would never spend that much on jewelry, but if someone else wanted to drop six figures on it for me, I wouldn't say no. If you love the environment but also love eating meat — and have $185,000 lying around — this Fantasy Gift has it all. Purchasers of this gift will get a trip to the James Beard Award-winning Perini Ranch Steakhouse in Buffalo Gap Texas, and get to meet the Perini family to learn about renewable energy and sustainable, ethical ranching. Plus, the gift includes a year supply of beef tenderloin. Yum."

Between the lines: Big Tech companies have plenty of their own cash and can easily borrow more, but only a finite amount of time to innovate before rivals capture their turf. In explaining the deal to investors on a previously scheduled conference call, CEO Marc Benioff characterized the move as a bet that the pandemic-driven shift to remote work isn't a temporary blip but rather a permanent transformation. The big picture: Benioff has long considered acquiring widely used business tools as a means to expand Salesforce's footprint beyond the sales and marketing teams and into the broader workforce. Salesforce kicked the tires on Twitter and lost out to Microsoft in a bidding war for LinkedIn. Slack has the lead in its still-nascent space, but was facing a challenge of its own — namely that Microsoft's rival Teams was bundled into Office subscriptions."

(Chang W. Lee/The New York Times) In 2004, I went to Ohio to cover John Kerry’s campaign to unseat George W. Bush. For liberals, the race felt existential. The Bush administration had lied America into war in Iraq, where an entirely predictable insurgency was raging. His military and CIA were torturing people; the Abu Ghraib scandal had broken open in April. A worshipful cult of personality surrounded the president, whose administration was nakedly disdainful of truth. Yet four years earlier Bush had lost the popular vote, in a race in which progressives were divided and a decisive number voted third party. Surely, it seemed, with the right mobilization, Democrats should be able to defeat him this time. Advertisement Liberal groups launched what Matt Bai described in The New York Times Magazine as “the largest get-out-the-vote effort ever undertaken to win a single presidential campaign.” It wasn’t enough. Democrats did increase their turnout, but Republicans increased theirs even more. Reporting from Ohio megachurches and right-wing rallies, I could see that many conservatives were motivated by the specter of gay marriage, which had been recognized in Massachusetts a few months earlier. In the election, 11 states including Ohio — including Oregon — passed ballot initiatives against same-sex marriage. Postelection surveys showed that “moral values” beat out issues like Iraq and the economy as voters' chief concern. Advertisement"

As she was preparing to come forward against Weinstein in 2016 and 2017, McGowan was approached by a woman she knew as Diana Filip, who purported to be an advocate for women. According to the suit, Filip gained McGowan’s confidence and was able to see a draft of “Brave,” McGowan’s memoir, in which she accused Weinstein of assaulting her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. McGowan later discovered that Filip was working for Black Cube, which had been hired by Weinstein and his attorneys. In a ruling on Monday, Judge Otis Wright dismissed nine of the 11 claims in the complaint. Several of the claims were dismissed because the suit was filed after the two-year statute of limitations. Wright also rejected the civil RICO charge on the grounds that the alleged scheme to trick her into turning over a copy of her book did not constitute racketeering activity. But Wright did allow McGowan to pursue two claims of fraud. Attorneys for Weinstein, Boies and Bloom had sought to have the claims dismissed on the grounds that the acts were committed by Black Cube, and not by them. But the judge found a plausible argument that they had hired Black Cube and were thus vicariously liable for the spy firm’s actions. McGowan had also argued that the fraud caused her significant harm, including lost job opportunities, damage to professional relationships and mental health issues."

Linmann, who was 23 when the story broke, had his career marked by the event. “I was asked about it almost every day of my life, by everybody,” Linnman recently told KATU, for their anniversary special of the historic local event. “I wrote a a book about it, and used the book to talk about other things that I was more excited about in journalism.” Ultimately, officials learned that not enough dynamite had been used in during their attempt to blow up the carcass."

Lee in the US Capitol By Leah Asmelash, CNN Updated 8:53 PM ET, Mon December 21, 2020 Roderick Johns, brother of civil rights activist Barbara Johns, holds a photo of his sister at the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial on the grounds of the State Capitol in Richmond on July 21, 2008. (CNN)When Barbara Johns was just 16 years old, she led a walkout at her high school to protest poor and unequal school conditions. The moment is one that many historians believe helped launch the desegregation movement in the US. By law, all states are allowed to donate two statues to the US Capitol for display around the building as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection, and they're able to replace existing statues through a process that involves the state's legislature and governor. The removal of the statue of Lee -- one of several statues around the Capitol depicting Confederate soldiers and officials -- is part of a larger trend of relegating symbols of the Confederacy, due to their racist nature."

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi at a poll rally in Kaimur. (File Photo: PTI) Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) made huge gains in the Bihar results, winning five seats out of 24 in the Seemanchal region. The party’s critics had accused it of being “vote cutters” in the polls, with the Congress dubbing the AIMIM as the BJP’s “B-team”. Here, Owaisi speaks to The Indian Express on the AIMIM’s growth graph in Bihar, its prospects in the upcoming Assembly elections in other states including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, and the allegation that his party helped divide the votes. The AIMIM has won five seats in Bihar. You had contested the last Assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha but could not win any seats. You won one Assembly seat in a bye-election later. How do you see the graph of your party in Bihar? Your question is absolutely right. After we lost in the last Assembly elections, since then we have been consistently working in Seemanchal in the last five years. We strengthened our organisation and other areas apart from Seemanchal. In the last Lok Sabha elections, our candidate got three lakh votes. Though we couldn’t win, we came third. Then we won a bye-election in Kishanganj. So in a way we were in a much better position as compared to five years ago in terms of organization, in terms of our hard work in terms of our visibility, in terms of raising issues. And, and also being amongst the people when floods came we held many medical camps, when those migrant labourers came back and they were suffering in quarantine centres our party members went there. So, basically, it was a great team effort. I must thank the people of Bihar, and especially the people of Seemanchal for voting for us. You were fighting against the BJP-JD(U) alliance. Overall, if you see the results, the NDA is back. And this time the BJP is the largest party in alliance. You were also on the opposition as were the RJD-Congress -Left . How do you explain this result?"

Shares of Tesla surged 12% on Monday in extended trade after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the company would join the S&P 500 index prior to the opening of trading on Dec. 21. “(Tesla) will be one of the largest weight additions to the S&P 500 in the last decade, and consequently will generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said.

863,Arts and Entertainment,"('-',)","The veteran South Korean actress' unflappable style encouraged director Lee Isaac Chung to get out of the way of Youn's no-nonsense Soonja. There’s a scene in Lee Isaac Chung’s melancholy but also delicately witty “Minari” where Korean grandmother Soonja (played by veteran actress Youn Yuh-jung) wants to try her grandson David’s (Alan S. Kim) Mountain Dew, the sugary, strange-colored soft drink he’s always guzzling. David doesn’t much care for his grandmother, who’s been sent from Korea to their poky Kansas trailer to babysit while his parents work at a factory, so what he hands her instead is a glass of his own urine. Appalling, right? It’s actually a hilarious, even heartwarming scene, as an unfazed Soonja laughs it off, and even admits, hey, that wasn’t so bad. That sort of unflappable spirit is evident in Youn herself, even from Seoul, nearly 7,000 miles away from New York during a phone interview with IndieWire. Youn has more than 40 credits to her name stretching back to 1971 with Kim Ki-young’s psychosexual thriller “Woman of Fire.” But, she insists, when she shows up to a set like “Minari” in the sweltering Ozarks of Oklahoma, she tries not to overthink any performance. Related “I didn’t think about playing this role differently [than any other],” Youn said of her award-winning turn in “Minari,” which is also gaining her first-ever Oscar buzz. “I just did it, communicating with [the cast] and reacting with them. Whatever they do, I just react.” Her show-up, find-your-mark, and read-your-line approach even earned her the imprimatur of filmmaker Lana Wachowski during Youn’s first brush with Hollywood on the Netflix series “Sense8” as “One-Take Wonder.” Youn earned that nickname, she said, “because I never needed more than one take.” On the set of “Minari,” where she said she was “all on her own” and “independent” in terms of direction, everyone called her “Old Foxy Lady.” At 73, Youn insists she is “an old-time actress.” So when a scene calls for Soonja to be uncomfortably close to lapping flames, and the director doesn’t say ‘cut,’ she’s not going to stop until somebody gives the word."

Warner Bros. delayed the release of Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi tentpole “Tenet” three times over the course of 2020 due to the pandemic, eventually dropping it in whatever theaters were possible on September 3. So it’s no shock to learn that Nolan, who’s currently doing press to promote the home video release of “Tenet,” isn’t keen on the studio’s seismic decision to dump all of its 2021 releases onto HBO Max (and day in date in available theaters) next year. Nolan told ET Online in a recent interview that he’s in “disbelief. Especially the way in which they did,” alluding to how allegedly many filmmakers weren’t given much notice, or any at all. “There’s such controversy around it, because they didn’t tell anyone. In 2021, they’ve got some of the top filmmakers in the world, they’ve got some of the biggest stars in the world who worked for years in some cases on these projects very close to their hearts that are meant to be big-screen experiences. They’re meant to be out there for the widest possible audiences… And now they’re being used as a loss-leader for the streaming service — for the fledgling streaming service — without any consultation. So, there’s a lot of controversy.” Related Nolan has long nurtured a relationship with studio Warner Bros. from “The Dark Knight” films to “Inception,” “Interstellar,” and “Dunkirk.” His Oscar-winning films perform consistently well at the box office, so it’s expected Nolan would be rankled by the decision. “It’s very, very, very, very messy. A real bait and switch. Yeah, it’s sort of not how you treat filmmakers and stars and people who– these guys have given a lot for these projects. They deserved to be consulted and spoken to about what was going to happen to their work,” he said. Nolan had stronger words in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter that slammed HBO Max as “the worst streaming service.”"

Lars von Trier has not officially announced a new project since he shocked Cannes again (again) with 2018’s serial-killer saga “The House That Jack Built.” For his next project, as announced by Zentropa Productions on Thursday, von Trier will be returning to the cult hospital series that established his TV presence in the mid-1990s, “The Kingdom.” Set in the neurosurgical ward of a Copenhagan hospital, the series, now dubbed “The Kingdom Exodus,” will return for a third and final season in 2022. Expected to shoot next year, the new revamp of “The Kingdom” will consist of five hour-long episodes. Check out videos teasing the return below. Producers say the new “Kingdom” will contain a mix of new and old characters from the original, which followed the idiosyncratic staff of the Danish hospital and their encounters with the supernatural and unexplainable. A third season of the show, which ended in 1997, was always planned but fell apart due to the deaths of cast members Ernst-Hugo Järegård and Kirsten Rolffes, as well as von Trier’s dedicated turn toward film. The new “Kingdom” season will be written in collaboration with Niels Vørsel, who helped von Trier pen the original series as well as some of his early features like “Europa,” “Epidemic,” and “The Element of Crime.” Related Von Trier will direct all five episodes, and while plot details remain under wraps, the Danish filmmaker did provide this statement: “Borders come in many forms; they may be lines drawn with rulers on white paper (often invisible to whoever chances to visit the actual geographical locations). The lines of the borders may be illustrative, if not to say quite fictitious and downright mean; they may be drawon in a soft, red color, practically invisible, and perhaps even as a dotted line, almost as if indicating an apology or even – shame. Nevertheless, the lines hang there in inconceivable numbers, and together they constitute those ‘territories’ that the inhabitants are strong enough to defend. Entering and leaving often entail violence, for, of course, any visitor is expected to return after ending his or her business. On Earth, “the Machine that makes everything go round (all life, that is)” is dependent on the conflicts which the lines provoke, as if by design. Whether Exodus actually means “entering” or “leaving” depends on the angle from which the border is observed, but the word simply describes a large number of individuals crossing a pencil-drawn line together."
866,Arts and Entertainment,"('-',)","Warner Bros.’ decision to drop its entire theatrical slate for 2021 day-and-date onto HBO Max has stoked ire among affected filmmakers. Directors like Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”) and Christopher Nolan (“Tenet”) have released scorching statements slamming the streaming service. “There is absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here,” Villeneuve wrote about the HBO Max decision last week. “It is all about the survival of a telecom mammoth.” In a new interview with The New York Times, WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar has offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the thought process that contributed to the big announcement. In the profile, he called the reactions from filmmakers “painful” and said, “We clearly have more work to do as we navigate this pandemic and the future alongside them.” He did defend the decision, however, and said that it was ultimately done with innovation, and the consumer, in mind. “There is no situation where everyone is going to stand up and applaud,” he said. “That’s not the way innovation plays out. This is not easy, nor is it intended to be easy. When you are trying something new, you have to expect and be ready for some people who are not comfortable with change. That’s OK.” Related Kilar admitted to The Times that Warners should have been “more sensitive” to how the news was going to be received by talent and filmmakers — and with such short notice. (Sources say that Legendary Pictures, the production company behind “Dune,” found out about the deal merely 30 minutes before Warners went public.) “A very important point to make — something I should have made a central part of our original communication — is we are thoughtfully approaching the economics of this situation with a guiding principle of generosity,” he said. While the company has been criticized for not consulting all stakeholders about the decision, Kilar defended that decision as well. “There are some things that you can talk and talk and talk about, but it doesn’t necessarily change the outcome,” he said. “I don’t think this would have been possible if we had taken months and months with conversations with every constituent. At a certain point you do need to lead. And lead with the customer top of mind and make decisions on their behalf.”"

The Echelon Stride has 12 levels, a max of 12 PMH, and a 10% incline. You can do your own workout, or you can sign up for Echelon Fitpass and use a tablet to follow classes. This treadmill is the cheapest one on the list, has over 3,100 reviews on Amazon, and will arrive before Christmas. It is like the perfect trifecta gift ahead of all the new year . When folded up, this treadmill is three feet long and two feet wide. Since this is a more budget-friendly model, it is a bit more limited in offerings. The max speed is 9 mph, it has only three incline settings (0%, 2%, or 4.37%), and 9 built-in workout programs. At just under $400, this XTERRA treadmill is a little pricier than the Sunny Health model but still a good budget-conscious option. It's got a max speed of 10 mph, three manual incline settings, and 12 pre-set workout programs. It has a one-touch button you can use to lower and raise the deck when folding the treadmill for storage. It has a sturdy steel frame and a 16"" x 50"" belt walking surface."

These recommendations are designed to decrease morbidity and mortality.” In Pima County, and throughout the state, the vaccine will be distributed in phases. Phase 1, which will likely span through March, is divided into three sections — 1A, 1B and 1C. The initial 1A section will include the county’s 67,000 health-care workers and the thousands of people working and living in long-term care facilities. The next section, 1B, will include adults in assisted living facilities, law enforcement, educators, child care workers and other essential service workers. The last section of the first phase, 1C, will include adults over the age of 65 and adults of any age who have high-risk medical conditions.

According to screenshots and videos making the rounds on social media, one scene seemingly has the words “Does Selena Gomez even have kidneys?” scrawled on the wall behind a row of lockers. In another scene, two students discuss Selena’s surgery, with one saying: “I know for a fact that Selena Gomez‘s kidney donor was Justin Bieber‘s mom…I wish that I had my phone so that I could prove it.” The other replies, “Prove what? That you’re an idiot? It was Demi Lovato‘s kidney. They’re best friends, like you and I were.” In a statement provided to Teen Vogue, representatives for Peacock said: ""We apologize. It was never our intention to make light of Selena’s health. We have been in touch with her team and will be making a donation to her charity, The Selena Gomez Fund for Lupus Research at USC.""

Advertisement At the time of writing, Selena has not commented on the matter. The singer-songwriter has been open in the past about her health journey, along with the life experiences shared with her good friend and kidney donor, Francia Raísa, who revealed in 2018 that Selena underwent an additional life-saving emergency surgery at the time of their transplant. “A few hours after our surgery, I woke up and had a text from her that said, ‘I’m really scared,’"" Francia previously told W Magazine. “My kidney was very active, and when it turned I broke an artery. They had to take her into emergency surgery and get a vein from her leg and build a new artery to keep my kidney in place. She could have died.” Given her celeb-status, Selena’s experiences have undoubtedly impacted others as well. While hosting WE Day in 2018, the “Rare"" singer explained just how big that impact has been. “As maybe some of you know, I had a kidney transplant this year and so many people from across the country reached out and they offered their support,” she said. “And others told me how hearing my story helped them find their own courage and helped other people want to get involved and donate.

Several actors, including Matthew Morrison, Jenna Ushkowitz, Dianna Agron, Kevin McHale, Heather Morris, Jane Lynch, and Chord Overstreet recently announced the Snixxmas Charity Drive in honor of Naya, with contributions going towards Alexandria House, a transitional residence for women and children. Before her untimely and tragic death earlier this year, Naya donated both financial contributions and her own time towards Alexandria House, describing her involvement with the organization as “the biggest blessing.” The new charity drive (named for Naya’s annual “Snixxmas” holiday party) aims to pay homage to the late actor’s passion for volunteer work, especially during a time of uncertainty and stress amid COVID-19. “This has been a hard year for so many, including the women and children of Alexandria House,” reads a note on the charity’s official GoFundMe page. “They have not only encountered the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also suffered a major loss when one of their two residences caught fire, displacing families and damaging the property.” As of Saturday afternoon, December 5, the GoFundMe has raised $67,000 of their $100,000 goal. In a video about the fundraiser, Naya’s former castmates explained the purpose of the project. “As the holiday season approaches, we can’t help but reflect on the year that’s passed,” Kevin says before the camera pans to Jenna, who adds: “And this year, the thing we’re thinking about most is our incredible friend Naya and the wonderful memories she’s left us with.” Later in the clip, Matthew notes that all of the actors will be making a donation to Alexandria House in Naya’s name, and that the GoFundMe was started so fans can contribute as well. “We ask you all to join in our effort to bring a little Snixxmas cheer into the lives of those in need,” finishes Jane. In a statement on the GoFundMe page, Naya’s family expressed their gratitude towards the late actor’s friends for putting the charity drive together. “Everyone will always be remembered and loved by her entire family,” they shared, adding: “Naya loved Christmas and we are pleased to know that her Christmas parties left a lasting impression on all of our lives. This fundraiser is an extension of Naya’s love for families, children, and holidays. To honor her in this manner is evidence that her love for others is endlessly alive. On behalf of Naya and her son Josey, the family would like to donate items from her Jojo & Izzy clothing line. We appreciate all who continue to shine Naya’s love and light.”"

Additionally, the foundation is awarding the seal, which is given to those projects that demonstrate a commitment toward authentic representation of people with disabilities by featuring actors with disabilities in a speaking role with at least five lines, to two films: “Sam & Mattie Make a Zombie Movie” and “Run.” “With each and every authentic casting decision, Hollywood takes another crucial step toward fulfilling its true and long-unrealized potential as a beacon of inclusion and diversity in all its forms,” said Jay Ruderman, president of the Ruderman Family Foundation. “The latest recipients of the Seal of Authentic Representation, building off the momentum generated by our previous rounds of honorees, powerfully exhibit the fact that Hollywood increasingly considers disability as an important part of diversity. We are hopeful and eager to see the conversation continue to move in this direction across the entertainment industry.” “Grey’s Anatomy” earned it for casting Shoshannah Stern, who is Deaf, as Dr. Lauren Riley in Season 16. “Representation matters profoundly,” said “Grey’s Anatomy” showrunner Krista Vernoff in a statement. “When people see themselves depicted in a way that is authentic, their imagination in terms of what is possible for their own lives expands. If Dr. Riley allowed even one deaf child to imagine for the first time that she could be a doctor, and if Shoshannah Stern’s portrayal inspired even one deaf child to believe that she could be an actress, that’s a beautiful thing.” “Little Voice” was awarded the seal for casting Kevin Valdez, an actor with autism, as Louie, a character who also has autism. “I’m proud to know that ‘Little Voice’ is receiving the Ruderman Foundation’s Seal of Authentic Representation and that the world is beginning to give everyone a chance, and for me to be a representative of the disabled community,” Valdez said. “It is an honor for me to have the chance to prove my abilities to the world. I hope that this inspires others to continue to invest in all people so they can showcase their talents to the public. Thanks to everybody who believed in me and advanced my career.”"

(Staff Sgt. Tia Schroeder/Air Force) An Air Force inspector general review into racial disparities found widespread differences, year after year, in how Black airmen are treated as opposed to airmen of other races. The investigation, which the Air Force released Monday, studied how Black airmen are affected by law enforcement apprehensions, criminal investigations, military justice, and administrative separations. It also reviewed which career fields Black airmen tend to be placed into, promotion rates, professional military educational development, and leadership opportunities. The result, said Air Force Inspector General Lt. Gen. Sami Said, is clear: Across the board, and consistently over time, Black airmen were disproportionately negatively affected in each category, as compared to their overall representation in the Air Force. The Air Force launched its effort to study racial disparities, and to survey airmen about race and their experiences in the service, in June, after the death of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests and movements to root out racial bias and inequality nationwide. The review also covered civilian personnel and Space Force guardians, as well as service members across the total force, both officers and enlisted. The report that resulted found that enlisted Black airmen were 72 percent more likely than their white counterparts to receive non-judicial punishments from their commanding officer, and 57 percent more likely than white service members to face a court-martial, the report said. Young Black enlisted airmen are almost twice as likely as their white counterparts to be involuntarily discharged for misconduct. And Black airmen are 1.64 times more likely to be suspects in Office of Special Investigations criminal cases, and twice as likely to be apprehended by security forces, the report said."

Edited excerpts: The mRNA Covid-19 vaccine by Gennova Biopharmaceuticals will hopefully not only achieve a similar efficacy to the candidates developed by Pfizer and Moderna, but will also be more affordably priced for a country like India, according to CEO Dr Sanjay Singh. How does your mRNA vaccine, which uses a self-amplifying model, compare with Pfizer and Moderna’s candidates? Our vaccine will work in a similar fashion to Pfizer’s and Moderna’s candidates. Regardless of the fact that this is based on the self-amplifying mRNA platform, it allows you to give the message to the cells, which converts it into the antigen, generating a neutralising immune response against the Covid-19 virus. Unlike ours, Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines use non-replicating mRNA. A self-amplifying type mRNA is much more beneficial in such a pandemic situation, where the vaccine deployment is not in millions, but billions. For the country’s population, this will be the most appropriate vaccine candidate. The advantage is that you can give maybe a lower dose of the vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine is reported to work at 100 micrograms in two doses, while Pfizer’s works at 30 micrograms in two doses. We are targeting 5, 10 and 25 micrograms and we hope that any one of these doses will prove to be efficacious. In a self-amplifying module, one mRNA molecule enters the cell and produces multiple copies, which will then make higher quantities of protein antigen compared to a similar dose of the non-replicating mRNA. Therefore, the effective dose can be quite less, providing a similar protection to disease. Another advantage of mRNA in general is that it never enters the nucleus and, thereby, there is no possibility of integration in the organism’s genome, where the DNA resides. It does its work in the cytoplasm, and because of this chemical structure, it is a naturally self-degrading molecule — it goes away within a limited time."

Simon & Schuster announced Monday that John Heilemann is working on a “dramatic, first-hand account” of Joe Biden's victorious campaigns over his Democratic Party rivals in the primaries and over President Donald Trump in the general election. Heilemann had collaborated with Mark Halperin on “Game Change,” about the 2008 race, and on “Double Down,” about 2012. Halperin has since faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment. He was dropped by Showtime, where he and Heilemann hosted the political series “The Circus,” and a planned book by the two authors on the 2016 campaign was canceled by Penguin Press. Heilemann's new book, currently untitled, draws on three decades of covering the former vice president, who was Barack Obama's running mate in 2008 and 2012. The publication date is not yet scheduled. “I first met Joe Biden in 1986 when I was in college and he was getting ready to run for president the first time, and I’ve been following his ups and downs, his triumphs and tragedies, ever since,” Heilemann said in a statement. “The story of how, against all odds and against the apocalyptic backdrop of America in 2020, Biden rallied in the winter of his life to defeat Trump — and, in the eyes of many, to save the country — is one of the great political tales of this or any age, and I’m thrilled to have a chance to tell it.”"

We talk about ""data gravity,"" the idea that workloads' portability is constrained by the bulk of that workload’s data. It’s data gravity that keeps applications locked into an infrastructure that may not be the most effective one to meet an evolving enterprise's needs. Today’s multi-cloud world complicates the management of data and storage. It can be time consuming and expensive to migrate large pools of data to the public cloud. On-prem applications can suffer unacceptable latencies when pulling data from the cloud, while cloud-based applications can be equally inefficient when relying on data that are stored elsewhere. Cloud adoption hinges on the ability to put data where it makes the most sense. The latency between storage and applications, wherever those applications live, needs to be managed. Data-protection is table-stakes. All of this has to be enabled through a simple to use management interface, but one flexible enough to integrate into API-driven automation tools. Amazon hosted its second AWS Storage Day last week, delivering a slew of updates that impact nearly every one of its storage offerings. There’s far more than can be covered here (for more detail, you should read the official AWS blog post describing the announcements), but let’s touch on the high points. Increased manageability Cloud is all about erasing complexity while delivering a push-button experience. That's not always an easy thing to provide when dealing with storage, where the underlying properties can be complicated, and automation crucial to delivering IT services at scale.

Karwai Tang Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall stood in for the Queen at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday, where they led the nation in two minutes of silence to mark Armistice Day. The 94-year-old monarch was advised by her medical team not to attend the service to mark the 100th anniversary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior, leaving Charles and Camilla to attend the ceremony in her place. Wearing a poppy-themed face mask, Camilla stood next to Charles in silence as passages from the Bible were read, before the prince laid a wreath on the Unknown Warrior's tomb. The service, also attended by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition party leader Keir Starmer, was led by the Dean of Westminster and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Wednesday also marks exactly 100 years since the Queen’s grandfather King George V unveiled the Cenotaph as a national memorial to the war dead of the First World War. Although Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge were not at today’s service, they marked Remembrance Day with a series of video calls this week to servicemen and women serving overseas and with families who have lost loved ones in combat. William told armed forces personnel serving overseas that he was “grateful” for the “important job” they are doing, while the Duchess comforted 11-year-old Charlton Taylor, whose father Michael Taylor was killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan in 2010. Kate, who joined the video call from Kensington Palace, asked Charlton to tell her about the medals he wore, asking: “Are those your daddy's medals? Wow.” Speaking from the couple’s Kensington Palace home, where pictures of the royal children and Prince William could be seen on a mantelpiece in the background beneath two paintings from the royal collection, Kate said that it was “so important” for the nation to come together on Armistice Day. Kate, who spent several years as a military wife while William served in the RAF, had a poppy pinned to her black and white blouse. Speaking to families who have lost loved ones she said, “I’m sure you spend your time every day remembering your loved ones, but it’s so important that the nation comes together and really spends time thinking about those who have lost their lives and the families that have been impacted. It's been a real honor to speak to all of you and I think I speak for the whole nation when I say just how proud you should be of your loved ones, and for the sacrifice and the bravery that they’ve shown. I’ll certainly be thinking of you this difficult week and will be for many years to come.” Other senior royals also marked the day, with Prince Edward and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex attending a Service of Remembrance at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, where they observed the national two-minute silence before laying wreaths at the Armed Forces Memorial. And Prince Harry, who was reportedly prevented from having a wreath laid in his honor at the Cenotaph, will appear as a special guest on November 18 at the annual Stand Up for Heroes event, which raises money for veterans.

The move opens Tesla up to a massive investor base: roughly $11 trillion worth of investment funds that track the index. Catch up quick: The company met the final requirement for eligibility — four consecutive quarters of profitability — when it reported its Q2 results in July. But the company was passed over when S&P Dow Jones Indices switched up the index's components in September. Wall Street analysts speculated that the reason was because of Tesla's dependency on the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers — without which, it wouldn't be profitable on a quarterly basis. Shares of Tesla, which ran up earlier this year on the expectation it would be added to the index, rose roughly 9% in after-hours trading. Details: The move is effective on Dec. 21."

Slideshow ( 2 images ) Steinmetz was indicted in August 2019 by a Geneva prosecutor who accused him and two aides of paying or having $10 million in bribes paid to one of the wives of former Guinean President Lansana Conte for mining licences between 2005 and 2010. “There are two charges, corruption and forgery. Both are categorically contested. The charges have no basis in fact or in law,” Marc Bonnant, a prominent Geneva lawyer representing Steinmetz, told Reuters on Friday. The lawyer questioned whether the late Conte was married to Mamadie Toure, named as a spouse of the late president in the indictment, during that time. Reuters attempted to contact Toure through social media, but she could not immediately be reached for comment. “Beny Steinmetz never paid a cent to Mme. Mamadie Toure. Mamadie Toure was not the wife of the president (Lansana Conte) and she is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,” Bonnant said. “Beny Steinmetz never signed forged documents, he was never an instigator of the signature of forged documents,” he added."

As I've pointed out before, there's a strongly negative correlation between revenue and net income. How long will bulls keep the faith in this circumstance? In my previous article, I suggested that people who insist on remaining long here would do well to sell some put options. That trade worked out well. Since I wrote my most recent bearish piece on Nutanix Inc. (NTNX), the shares are up about 22% against a gain of ~8% for the S&P 500. This demands commentary, obviously. In addition, the company has posted financial results recently, and I should spend some time picking them apart to see if there have been any great surprises. Also, the stock is a thing distinct from the underlying business, so I need to write about that also. I'll try to keep an open mind and will decide on the merits of whether it's worth switching poles on this stock at the current price. Finally, while I was skeptical about the value of the stock in my most recent article, I did suggest investors who insist on remaining long here sell the April puts with a strike of $17.50. I should look in on that trade to see how it's doing relative to the stock. I'll spoil the surprise a little bit by suggesting that I think the risk reward on the short put was actually better than the stock. Before getting into all of that, though, I'll write briefly about the dangers of short-term thinking when it comes to stocks. I think this stock is particularly instructive in this regard, so I may as well make the point today. The Danger of Short-Term Thinking I think investor's tendency to think about short-term price movements does them no favours. I'll make that point by looking at the very recent history here, and by looking at my own history of covering this name. First, the very recent history. The shares are down about 8% since the CEO hosted the earnings call a short time ago. That drop in price happened in spite of the view that ""the company is successfully transitioning to a recurring software model in a very challenging business environment"", etc."

The drugmaker announced the analysis of its complete data set came back over the weekend and showed the vaccine to be 94 percent effective. That confirms the company’s initial data analysis released two weeks ago. Moderna’s application comes 10 days after Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech submitted their bid for emergency use of their vaccine candidate to the FDA. There are still regulatory hurdles that each vaccine must clear, but if both are confirmed to be safe and effective, there could be enough supply to vaccinate some 20 million Americans by the end of the year. The Moderna vaccine, developed in conjunction with government researchers at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, underwent a 30,000-person clinical trial that tested the vaccine against a placebo. The company said of the 30,000 participants, 196 cases of Covid-19 were detected and just 11 of those were from the group receiving the vaccine. Even more encouraging is that all 30 severe cases of the disease were found in the group receiving the placebo. Moderna also reported the vaccine to be equally effective across different demographic groups accounting for age, race, and gender. Moderna said it will also seek approval from regulators in Europe, the U.K., and Canada. “The FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there’s enough evidence behind each candidate,” the Associated Press reports. “First up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this ‘science court’ is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.”"

The brand is on sale across the board at retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy, with many models hitting or matching all-time lows, including $29 for our Editors' Choice Award winner, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, $69 for the all-new Roku Ultra and $100 for the new Roku Streambar. These streaming devices can all stream in 4K HDR, and Roku just added AirPlay to its stable of features, a sweet holiday gift for Apple fans. There are also a few good prices to be found on Roku smart TV options, too (though TV manufacturers seem to be funneling the cheap prices more to the Android TV platform this year). Note that prices and availability were accurate at the time of publication, but the latest deals may fluctuate. We're keeping this updated, so check back throughout the weekend. Last month we saw a lot of deals on the end-of-life Roku Ultra, but the 2020 model has barely been out and it's getting discounted already. From what we've seen it's a significant upgrade -- with Dolby Vision and better wireless performance -- and at $69 it's a pretty great deal. Read our Roku Ultra (2020) review. Like the Roku Ultra, the Streambar came out about 10 seconds ago and it's also getting a healthy discount. For the same price as the Ultra on a normal day, the Streambar blends a capable 4K streamer with a dialogue-enhancing soundbar. It even tosses in Bluetooth for good measure. Read our Roku Streambar review. We've never tested an Onn-branded TV (that's Walmart's in-house electronics line). But if you're looking for a giant screen television running the Roku OS, here it is. This model appears to be a Black Friday special SKU, birthed for the end of 2020 and selling for just under $450. But that's $200 less than this identically sized JVC model, also running Roku. The TCL 4-Series is our go-to recommendation for 32-inch TVs because of its built-in Roku platform, not anything to do with image quality. We expect Walmart's house brand Onn to perform about the same and since it also has Roku built in, it's a better value. This is a bare-bones Roku that can handle all your streaming needs. It isn't as fast as the Streaming Stick Plus and doesn't include Roku's more useful enhanced remote (which has a microphone for voice control and doesn't require you to point it directly at the TV).

It caters to both fresh graduates entering the job market for the first time and mid-career workers, who may or may not have prior experience in a particular sector. ""Incomes of those in the broad middle class have stagnated in a whole range of advanced economies - with a few like Sweden and Singapore being the exceptions,"" he said. ""And jobs have been created mainly at the high and low skilled ends of the labour market - like a barbell structure - with fewer jobs in the middle."" However with Covid-19, even the ""bottom end of the barbell is shrinking"" with a whole range of service tasks being eliminated by e-commerce, remote work, and safe distancing guidelines which will likely continue to be in place for the next few years. The pandemic is far from being tamed, and vaccines cannot be expected to be a quick fix, he said, warning of a slow and bumpy economic recovery internationally and possible repeated lockdowns. ""The good news: if there is one thing we've learnt from how Singapore has brought down local transmission of the virus to close to zero, it is that we will succeed if we all play our part. We have to apply this same orientation towards jobs, and more forcefully than ever before,"" he said. The Government and its tripartite partners are sparing no effort on this front, he added."

And now the coronavirus has delivered another twist: luxury western rock lobsters available for the historically low price of $20 in time for Christmas. Let’s first address the lobster in the room. Some shoppers are unable to find the bargain luxury seafood at the supermarkets, so do $20 lobsters actually exist? And if so, why are they so cheap? Coles and Woolworths assure customers they are indeed available. But you have to be quick to get them. A Coles spokeswoman said there had already been an “overwhelming” response to the cut-price sale, and tens of thousands of lobsters have sold since the promotion was announced earlier this month. More lobsters arrive each day in stores and the offer will be available until January 5. At Woolworths the half-price offer on the lobster is available up to Christmas Day. In the first five days of the deal people bought four times as much lobster as was purchased in the whole of last year's festival season. “We’ve also ordered more than 20 times the amount of rock lobster versus last year,” a Woolworths spokesman said. But even if you get your hands on a lobster with a rock-bottom price tag, your traditional Christmas dinner may still be affected in other ways by the pandemic. While COVID-19 hasn't completely changed what's available, the price of each of the ingredients could be vastly different than what was cooked up 12 months ago.

But over the past few months, things have happened fast: Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock citing “irreconcilable differences” (celeb-speak for “stay tuned”), Blackstock’s father sued Clarkson for unpaid management fees she’d agreed to in a 13-year-old phone call, and Clarkson hit back with a labor petition against the management group. We’ve also seen Clarkson granted primary custody of their kids River Rose and Remy — and now, we’ve seen Blackstock’s first offer of what he expects to take out of this divorce. In court documents obtained by TMZ, Blackstock asks for a staggering $5.2 million in annual support from Clarkson — $300,000 monthly for spousal support and $136,000 monthly for child support. Look, I see where Blackstock is coming from. I, too, would like $5 million a year paid to me by Kelly Clarkson. It sounds great! But unlike Blackstock, who brazenly requested both that amount of support and an additional $2 million in attorney fees, I have to assume I’d be too embarrassed to ask. Clarkson, who we imagine is surprised to learn that Blackstock expects to be provided for at this rate, opened up on The Kelly Clarkson Showabout the “horrible” process of figuring out their divorce. “It’s horrible. There are so many hard parts and the hardest for me is the kids,” she told guests Glennon Doyle and Alicia Keys. “That’s the hardest part for me. You know, I always think as women especially we’re trained — Alicia and I were talking earlier — to take it all on and you can deal with it and you’re fine. But it’s your babies that you worry about.” Our hearts are with Clarkson as she and her attorneys figure out how best to reply."
