Priyanka Sharma New Delhi June 21, 2018UPDATED: June 21, 2018 18:59 IST Chair posture is proving beneficial for patients who can’t sit on the floor or have disabilities Chair posture is proving beneficial for patients who can’t sit on the floor or have disabilities Even in matters of the heart, literally speaking, yoga has an impact. A study by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has established that a person can regulate her/his heartbeats through yoga. AIIMS, in what it claimed to be the first study of its kind to have scientifically established the benefits of yoga, revealed that breathing in a particular rhythm has many positive effects on cardiovascular health. It also helps in overcoming anger, fear, stress and hypertension. Dr KK Deepak, author of the study and head of the Department of Physiology at AIIMS, told Mail Today: A slow yogic breathing can curtail the feeling of stress, fear, anger, tension and also regulate diabetes. The study has found that there is a correlation between heartbeat and blood pressure. Yogic breathing can synchronise the two which is a big deal.  The results of the study, funded by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the Ministry of AYUSH, have been published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Medical Research. When we do deep-breathing, blood pressure comes into the normal range. This indicates that there is a strong relationship between heart rate and blood pressure. If a persons heart rate falls, suddenly the BP will go up and if the BP comes down, the heart rate shoots up. Thus, creating a balance between the two is very important - which can be done by yogic breathing,  Dr Deepak said. In another study conducted by RML Hospital, doctors have found that practising asanas led to significant improvement in patients suffering from mental health illnesses, as compared with those who did other forms of exercise. We made two groups of patients yoga and non-yoga. The yoga group patients cognitive behaviour improved tremendously as compared to the patients doing other exercises, said (Prof) Smita N. Deshpande, Head the Department of Psychiatry & De-Addiction at RML Hospital. Chair Yoga for health Offering relief to patients who cannot sit on floor, Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has introduced a new yoga initiative called 'chair yoga' in which the patients can remain seated on a chair and perform health postures. Dr Soina Rawat, director at the department of executive health check up at the hospital, said,A large number of patients were facing problems in doing yoga because of various disabilities. They wanted to practice yoga but couldnt sit on the floor. So we started the concept of chair yoga at our hospital. It is really helpful and their health status has improved. Binda Shukla, 50, is one patient who has been practicing chair yoga for several months. She suffers from upper body stiffness, and has cervical and cholesterol problems. There is definitely relief ever since I started doing meditation and yoga. I feel fresh when I perform deep breathing asanas and am taking less medication now. Even those who have knee joint related complications are comfortable with chair yoga, says Dr Shukla To see whether yoga can improve cognitive functions of patients with severe mental disorder as compared to cardiac controls and to compare improvements in patients with schizophrenia. Time period: Samples of last two years in the study included patients with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and cardiac controls. Patients were aged between 18-60. Another study was conducted to ascertain randomised control trail on schizophrenia on yoga and non-yoga groups. Exercises: Yoga training included chanting of Om, warm up exercises, breathing (pranayama), various yogic asanas Results: There was an improvement in the speed parameters of most of the cognitive domains among patients with schizophrenia after yoga, compared with the schizophrenia non-yoga group patients. The healthy parameters sustained for six months at least.
